and it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task , but what i &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that i think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
and those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and i &apos;m going to start with this one : if momma ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
we know that , right ? we &apos;ve experienced that .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
that &apos;s the theme of my talk .
and we &apos;re making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
this is a shot of cannery row in 1932 .
cannery row , at the time , had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast .
we piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
rolf bolin , who was a professor at the hopkin &apos;s marine station where i work , wrote in the 1940s that &quot; the fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black . &quot;
people working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
they say , &quot; you know what you smell ?
that pollution was money to that community , and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
we made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages , and i want to call that &quot; pinch a minnow , hurt a whale . &quot;
the pyramid of ocean life ...
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- i have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
we see the base of the food chain , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
and that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . heal the ocean . &quot;
now why does that matter for human health ?
because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very frightening things happen .
pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like pcbs that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
and they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up ; they &apos;re passed up that way , on to predators and on to the top predators , and in so doing , they accumulate .
now , to bring that home , i thought i &apos;d invent a little game .
we don &apos;t really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
it &apos;s the styrofoam and chocolate game .
imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two styrofoam peanuts .
can &apos;t do much with them : put them in your pocket .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too .
what &apos;ll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the drunkest , stingiest people .
there &apos;s no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible styrofoam peanuts .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens with pdbs in this food pyramid : they accumulate into the top of it .
now suppose , instead of styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around , and instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they &apos;re absorbed by us .
and that &apos;s the difference between a pcb and , say , something natural like an omega-3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
pcbs accumulate in dolphins in sarasota bay , in texas , in north carolina .
they get into the food chain .
the dolphins eat the fish that have pcbs from the plankton , and those pcbs , being fat-soluble , accumulate in these dolphins .
now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there &apos;s only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .
and what &apos;s that ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
adult males : a huge load .
juveniles : a huge load .
females after their first calf is already weaned : a lower load .
those females , they &apos;re not trying to .
those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their offspring , and their offspring don &apos;t survive .
the death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant , and most of them die .
now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf .
there &apos;s another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo -- or is it ?
in fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
that &apos;s another story .
even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
and those dolphin parts had a huge load of pcbs , dioxins and heavy metals .
and that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
that &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
we had these data a few years ago .
i remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
and for the very first time in my scientific career , i broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them .
we sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation , not for us , but for the people of japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
that led to a whole series of other campaigns in japan , and i &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in japan that &apos;s labeled incorrectly , even though they &apos;re still selling whale meat , which i believe they shouldn &apos;t .
but at least it &apos;s labeled correctly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
it isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the canadian arctic and in the united states and in the european arctic , a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of pcbs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
these women have toxic breast milk .
they cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
that means their immune systems are compromised .
it means that their children &apos;s development can be compromised .
and the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women , not by changing the pyramid , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
we &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
there &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyramid .
the pyramid , if we jam things in the bottom , can get backed up like a sewer line that &apos;s clogged .
and if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
we end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red tides , for example , which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage .
we can also see blooms of bacteria , blooms of viruses in the ocean .
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
how many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
why does that happen ?
it happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
not very often . we wouldn &apos;t tolerate that .
we wouldn &apos;t tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage , but beaches are closed a lot in our country .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
it &apos;s not just a question of cleanliness ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
these vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
they can go into your skin and create skin infections .
this is a graph from noaa &apos;s ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years .
surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
and if you can see on some surfing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some surf rider sites , you see a little flashing poo alert .
that means that the beach might have great waves , but it &apos;s a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of surfing , this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve .
some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now , and that makes them even more difficult .
these same infections create harmful algal blooms .
those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms : shellfish poisoning , fish ciguatera , diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning , paralytic shellfish poisoning .
these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms .
rita calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this copepod .
copepods are small crustaceans .
they &apos;re a tiny fraction of an inch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these vectors of cholera around the world .
so what do you do ?
we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged .
well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
you could call joe the plumber , for example .
and he could come in and fix the flow .
but in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fixed , where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around .
monterey is one of those .
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
in 1932 , that &apos;s the picture .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
the canneries are gone . the pollution has abated .
but there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems .
they need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top .
and that pyramid in monterey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it &apos;s ever functioned for the last 150 years .
it didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
on the left there , julia platt , the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove .
at 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
in 1931 , she produced california &apos;s first community-based marine protected area , right next to the biggest polluting cannery , because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed , and she wanted to provide that seed .
other people , like david packard and julie packard , who were instrumental in producing the monterey bay aquarium to lock into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
well , i want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid , and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life .
it &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species , but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
and it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves .
there &apos;s a tight and surprising link between the ocean &apos;s health and ours , says marine biologist stephen palumbi . he shows how toxins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies , with a shocking story of toxic contamination from a japanese fish market . his work points a way forward for saving the oceans &apos; health -- and humanity &apos;s .
adrian kohler : well , we &apos;re here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse .
basil jones : but actually we &apos;re going to start this evolution with a hyena .
okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; faustus in africa , &quot; a handspring production from 1995 , where it had to play draughts with helen of troy .
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director , william kentridge .
so it needed a very articulate front paw .
but , like all puppets , it has other attributes .
ak : haa haa haaa .
bj : breath is really important for us .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
puppets always have to try to be alive .
it &apos;s their kind of ur-story onstage , that desperation to live .
ak : yeah , it &apos;s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
an actor struggles to die onstage , but a puppet has to struggle to live .
and in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
bj : so every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the struggle .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs .
ak : well actually i prefer to say that it &apos;s an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life .
ak : it has ears that move passively when the head goes .
bj : and it has these bulkheads made out of plywood , covered with fabric -- curiously similar , in fact , to the plywood canoes that adrian &apos;s father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop .
and when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971 , i hated puppets .
and , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa , where there &apos;s a fabulous tradition of puppetry , to learn a renewed , or a new , respect for this art form .
ak : so in 1981 , i persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company .
and 20 years later , miraculously , we collaborated with a company from mali , the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako , where we made a piece about a tall giraffe .
it was just called &quot; tall horse , &quot; which was a life-sized giraffe .
the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
ak : the person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail , a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism , just a bit bigger .
and he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
bj : so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : it &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
the horse is sold to the first world war , and he joins up to find his horse .
bj : so tom gave us a call and said , &quot; do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national theatre ? &quot;
ak : it seemed a lovely idea .
bj : but it had to ride . it had to have a rider .
a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london .
so we began with a test .
bj : this is adrian and thys stander , who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse , and our next-door neighbor katherine , riding on a ladder .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
so we made a model .
this is a cardboard model , a little bit smaller than the hyena .
you &apos;ll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there .
bj : and the two manipulators are inside .
ak : we started work on the prototype after the model was approved , and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated .
and we had a crate built for it .
it had to be shipped to london .
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town , and it got to midnight and we hadn &apos;t done that yet .
bj : so we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances .
and we sent it off to the national theatre , hoping that they believed that we created something that worked .
ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
bj : about 40 people .
ak : we were terrified .
we opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden .
here i have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype .
this is in the national theatre studio , the place where they cook new ideas .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
the choreographer , toby sedgwick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse .
and nick starr , the director of the national theatre , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself .
and so the show was given the green light .
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .
here is the plan .
and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
the horses are completely handmade .
but because they have to be light and flexible , and each one of them is different , they can &apos;t be mass-produced , unfortunately .
so here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in london .
joey boy , you there ?
joey .
joey .
joey , come here .
no , no , i haven &apos;t got it .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
move around . come on .
i &apos;d just like to describe -- i won &apos;t talk too loud . he might get irritated .
here , craig is working the head .
he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
but he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
when they point right back , the horse is fearful or angry , depending upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
or , when he &apos;s more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
horses &apos; hearing is very important .
it &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
over here , tommy &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
he &apos;s working the leg .
you see the string tendon from the hyena , the hyena &apos;s front leg , automatically pulls the hoop up .
horses are so unpredictable .
the way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convincing horse action .
and together , there &apos;s quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that &apos;s how a horse would breathe , with an expanded chest .
so he made a channel in here , and the chest moves up and down in that channel .
so it &apos;s anti-naturalistic really , the up and down movement , but it feels like breath .
and it &apos;s very , very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .
if i were to touch the horse here on his skin , the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
the skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh , which , if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear , she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
or if you light it from above , it becomes more solid .
again , that was a practical consideration .
the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
they have to be able to act and it &apos;s very much an in-the-moment activity that they &apos;re engaged in .
it &apos;s three heads making one character .
but now we would like you to put joey through some paces .
and plant .
thank you .
and now just -- all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who &apos;s going to ride the horse for us .
so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly .
bj : not being able to talk to one another while they &apos;re onstage because they &apos;re mic &apos;d .
the sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer , carries on with a second person and ends with a third .
ak : mikey brett from leicestershire .
thank you . thank you .
handspring puppet co . : the genius puppetry behind war horse
&quot; puppets always have to try to be alive , &quot; says adrian kohler of the handspring puppet company , a gloriously ambitious troupe of human and wooden actors . beginning with the tale of a hyena &apos;s subtle paw , puppeteers kohler and basil jones build to the story of their latest astonishment : the wonderfully life-like joey , the war horse , who trots convincingly onto the stage .
let &apos;s start with day and night .
life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
these are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
i &apos;ll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a sloped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it &apos;ll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
it &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
people actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole .
so , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
it &apos;s a huge driver for culture and i think that it &apos;s the most underrated force on our behavior .
we evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
but of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada , where i live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
so the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
and in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
so , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sunrise .
and in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
and during this time , there &apos;s a surge of prolactin , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they &apos;re experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .
so , cut to the modern day .
we &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
thank you .
jessa gamble : our natural sleep cycle
in today &apos;s world , balancing school , work , kids and more , most of us can only hope for the recommended eight hours of sleep . examining the science behind our body &apos;s internal clock , jessa gamble reveals the surprising and substantial program of rest we should be observing .
i want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
and in doing that , i want to offer you a vision , an imagined future , if you will , of how , as the poet seamus heaney has put it , &quot; once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history rhyme . &quot;
i want to start with these word pairs here .
we all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk-averse .
and in fact they weren &apos;t . they were reinventing charity in those times , what rockefeller called &quot; the business of benevolence . &quot;
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way .
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .
and it &apos;s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pressures .
i &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
this report is our main public report .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
what i want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you .
and as i do that , i &apos;m not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the gates or the soros or the google .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us : the democratization of philanthropy .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
the first is mass collaboration , represented here by wikipedia .
now , this may surprise you .
but remember , philanthropy is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
clay shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
he said , &quot; we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
now we have wikipedia .
suddenly big things can be done for love . &quot;
watch , this spring , for paul hawken &apos;s new book -- author and entrepreneur many of you may know about .
the book is called &quot; blessed unrest . &quot;
and when it comes out , a series of wiki sites under the label wiser , are going to launch at the same time .
wiser stands for world index for social and environmental responsibility .
wiser sets out to document , link and empower what paul calls the largest movement , and fastest-growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective immune response to today &apos;s threats .
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fastest , the most connected form of philanthropy in human history .
this is , of course , to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce .
think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy .
and this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy .
take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at donorschoose .
omidyar network has made a big investment in donorschoose .
it &apos;s one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
take a look at changing the present , started by a tedster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
giveindia is for a whole country .
and it goes on and on .
the third category is represented by warren buffet , which i call aggregated giving .
it &apos;s not just that warren buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer .
it &apos;s that he challenged another assumption , that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation .
there are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
one of the best known is acumen fund , led by jacqueline novogratz , a tedster who got a big boost here at ted .
but there are many others : new profit in cambridge , new school &apos;s venture fund in silicon valley , venture philanthropy partners in washington , global fund for women in san francisco .
take a look at these .
these funds are to philanthropy what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are to investing , but with a twist -- because often a community forms around these funds , as it has at acumen and other places .
now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online marketplaces , aggregated giving .
and understand how they help us re-perceive what organized philanthropy is .
it &apos;s not about foundations necessarily ; it &apos;s about the rest of us .
and imagine the mash-up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up , say , 100 million dollars for an inspiring goal -- there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the us last year , not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it &apos;s matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe , thereby engaging lots of people , and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that &apos;s stated .
they &apos;re betting a visible competition , a prize , can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and thereby speed the solution .
this tackles yet another assumption , that the giver and the organization is at the center , as opposed to putting the problem at the center .
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
that leaves the final category , social investing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , represented here by xigi.net.
and this , of course , tackles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
xigi is a new community site that &apos;s built by the community , linking and mapping this new social capital market .
it lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise .
so we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be astonishing .
now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .
philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes .
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don &apos;t yet fulfill this aspiration , i think this is the new zeitgeist : open , big , fast , connected , and , let us also hope , long .
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .
if we don &apos;t develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a fad .
but i &apos;m really hopeful .
and i &apos;m hopeful because it &apos;s not only philanthropy that &apos;s reorganizing itself , it &apos;s also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
and everywhere i go , including here at ted , i feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing .
what we &apos;re seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that &apos;s happening .
words like &quot; philanthrocapitalism , &quot; and &quot; natural capitalism , &quot; and &quot; philanthroentrepreneur , &quot; and &quot; venture philanthropy . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a language for it yet .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and i think it &apos;s gong to quite significant .
and that &apos;s where my imagined future comes in , which i am going to call the social singularity .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge &apos;s notion of a technological singularity , where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create , really , a shockingly new reality .
that &apos;s because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them .
and as we &apos;ve heard here , it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before .
the question is , is there a positive social singularity ?
is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
our future doesn &apos;t have to be imagined .
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme .
but we have a problem .
our experience to date , both individually and collectively , hasn &apos;t prepared us for what we &apos;re going to need to do , or who we &apos;re going to need to be .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
that &apos;s why i have one last thing i want to show you .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
this is a newspaper publisher and a banker .
and they were great community leaders .
and , yes , they were great philanthropists .
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
and so , in their honor , i want to offer you this blank slide .
and i want you to imagine that this a photograph of you .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
whatever that means to you .
and i want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grandchild , or great-grandchild , or niece or nephew or god-child , is looking at this photograph of you .
katherine fulton : you are the future of philanthropy
in this uplifting talk , katherine fulton sketches the new future of philanthropy -- one where collaboration and innovation allow regular people to do big things , even when money is scarce . giving five practical examples of crowd-driven philanthropy , she calls for a new generation of citizen leaders .
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of &quot; democratization of intimacy . &quot;
and what do i mean by that ?
i mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication channels , they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them .
how are they doing this ? they &apos;re doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by iming from their office to their friends , by texting under the desk .
the pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months .
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
and somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
one young woman brought her grandfather .
for 20 years , i &apos;ve been looking at how people use channels such as email , the mobile phone , texting , etc .
what we &apos;re actually going to see is that , fundamentally , people are communicating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most intimate sphere .
now , lets take some data . facebook .
recently some sociologists from facebook -- facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels .
and an average user , said cameron marlow , from facebook , has about 120 friends .
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
and when you go to skype , it &apos;s down to two people .
a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
i mean , i &apos;ve been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people .
and some sociologists actually feel that it &apos;s a closure , it &apos;s a cocooning , that we &apos;re disengaging from the public .
and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples .
and so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
and around eight o &apos;clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven , cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife .
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
and i &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
a young factory worker who works night shifts , who manages to sneak away from the factory floor , where there is cctv by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o &apos;clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;clock , suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home .
then there is another couple , there is a brazilian couple .
they &apos;ve lived in italy for a number of years .
they skype with their families a few times a week .
but once a fortnight , they actually put the computer on their dining table , pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo . and they have a big event of it .
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland .
they had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother .
but danny miller , who is a very good anthropologist who is working on filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the philippines , was telling me about how much parenting is going on through skype , and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through skype .
and then there is the third couple . they are two friends .
they chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
and this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends .
so , none of these cases are unique .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
but what is really exceptional is the setting .
but it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital .
three settings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clocked in , when you clocked in to an office , when you clocked in to a factory , there was no contact for the whole duration of the time , there was no contact with your private sphere .
if you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere .
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
maybe you had a direct line .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
and it had nothing to do with technical capability .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
that was where the focus had to be .
and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage .
if you think nursery , kindergarten , first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children , to make them used to staying long hours away from their family .
and then the school enacts perfectly well .
it mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices : rituals of entry , rituals of exit , the schedules , the uniforms in this country , things that identify you , team-building activities , team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
this only started about 150 years ago .
it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades .
they were living on top of the land they were laboring .
and if you think , it &apos;s permeated our whole culture , even our cities .
if you think of medieval cities , medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there .
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
and they are doing it massively .
the pew institute , which produces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the states , says that -- and i think that this number is conservative -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
i really think that the number is conservative .
in my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o &apos;clock in the morning , whatever the country .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
100 percent are using text .
the point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions .
i &apos;m always surprised the u.s. army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .
but there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access .
and every day , every single day , i read news that makes me cringe , like a $ 15 fine to kids in texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
immediate dismissal to bus drivers in new york , if seen with a mobile phone in a hand .
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy .
stefana broadbent : how the internet enables intimacy
we worry that im , texting , facebook are spoiling human intimacy , but stefana broadbent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships , bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules .
maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
maybe you thought , i &apos;ve had less to drink than everybody else , i should be the one to go home .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
does this sound familiar to you ?
now , in those situations , wouldn &apos;t it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push , and the car would get you home safely ?
now , that &apos;s been the promise of the self-driving car , the autonomous vehicle , and it &apos;s been the dream since at least 1939 , when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world &apos;s fair .
now , it &apos;s been one of those dreams that &apos;s always seemed about 20 years in the future .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of nevada granted google &apos;s self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada .
now , california &apos;s considering similar legislation , and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas .
now , in my lab at stanford , we &apos;ve been working on autonomous cars too , but with a slightly different spin on things . you see , we &apos;ve been developing robotic race cars , cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance .
now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
well , there &apos;s two really good reasons for this .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car , that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers .
now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
there &apos;s another reason as well .
just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road , all of the car &apos;s capabilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can .
now , you may push the car to the limits not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an icy patch of road , conditions have changed .
in those situations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided .
i must confess , there &apos;s kind of a third motivation as well .
you see , i have a passion for racing .
in the past , i &apos;ve been a race car owner , a crew chief and a driving coach , although maybe not at the level that you &apos;re currently expecting .
it &apos;s another one of those categories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
but this is p1 . it &apos;s an entirely student-built electric vehicle , which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
we &apos;ve also worked with volkswagen oracle , on shelley , an autonomous race car that has raced at 150 miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats , gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel .
i guess it goes without saying that we &apos;ve had a lot of fun doing this .
but in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars .
we have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers .
as we &apos;ve looked at the question of how well do these cars perform , we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts .
and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing .
now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathematical model of a car , and with some iteration , we can actually find the fastest way around that track .
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver , and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable .
yes , there are subtle differences here , but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line , without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade-off between going as fast as possible in this corner , and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here .
they &apos;re able to go out and consistently do this , pushing the car to the limits every single time .
it &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
you put them in a new car , and after a few laps , they &apos;ve found the fastest line in that car , and they &apos;re off to the races .
it really makes you think , we &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on inside their brain .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
now , this is dr. lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton .
john morton is a former can-am and imsa driver , who &apos;s also a class champion at le mans .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
she &apos;s putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john &apos;s brain as he races around the track .
however , neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
in contrast , theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual processing , things where the driver is thinking quite a bit .
now , we can measure this , and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves .
this gives us a measure of mental workload , how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track .
now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we headed down south to laguna seca .
laguna seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between salinas and monterey .
it has a curve there called the corkscrew .
now , the corkscrew is a chicane , followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories .
now , the strategy for driving this as explained to me was , you aim for the bush in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
all right , so thanks to the revs program at stanford , we were able to take john there and put him behind the wheel of a 1960 porsche abarth carrera .
life is way too short for boring cars .
so , here you see john on the track , he &apos;s going up the hill -- oh ! somebody liked that -- and you can see , actually , his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches .
now watch , he has to downshift .
look for the tree , and down .
not surprisingly , you can see this is a pretty challenging task .
you can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity .
but what &apos;s really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn &apos;t increase .
i &apos;m going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
turn three . and john &apos;s going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
he &apos;s going to have to correct for that with steering .
so watch as john does this here .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
not a challenging task .
in fact , entirely reflexive .
now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
it requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats .
and their actions are fantastic .
this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation .
now , this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles .
we &apos;ve started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive ?
can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers , introduce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans .
but it &apos;s made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur ?
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
so , as we move forward into this technological future , i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment .
what is the ideal balance of human and machine ?
and as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind .
thank you .
chris gerdes : the future race car -- 150mph , and no driver
autonomous cars are coming -- and they &apos;re going to drive better than you . chris gerdes reveals how he and his team are developing robotic race cars that can drive at 150 mph while avoiding every possible accident . and yet , in studying the brainwaves of professional racing drivers , gerdes says he has gained a new appreciation for the instincts of professional drivers . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the first one is happening right here in chicago .
brenda palms-farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
we know that two-thirds of them are going to go back .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
but brenda , not being phased by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution : create a business that produces skin care products from honey .
okay , it might be obvious to some of you ; it wasn &apos;t to me .
it &apos;s the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
she hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees , harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves , and that were later sold at whole foods .
she combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed , like anger-management and teamwork , and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more .
less than four percent actually go back to jail .
so these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process .
talk about a sweet beginning .
now , i &apos;m going to take you to los angeles , and lots of people know that l.a. has its issues .
they have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains .
currently , 20 percent of california &apos;s energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly southern california .
their spending loads , loads , to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well .
now andy lipkis is working to help l.a. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees , people and technology to create a more livable city .
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
because , come to think about it , do you really want air-conditioning , or is it a cooler room that you want ?
how you get it shouldn &apos;t make that much of a difference .
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves .
and by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure .
so ultimately , 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided , and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down , while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up , resulting in a net-savings to the system , but also healthier students and schools system employees as well .
now judy bonds is a coal miner &apos;s daughter .
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
and if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be judy .
but the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father &apos;s father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
now , two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years &apos; worth of coal .
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it &apos;s filled with the residue of explosives and coal .
when we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners , but everybody .
and judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain , and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet .
three years of dirty energy with not many jobs , or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills , and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region &apos;s wind .
she calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time , and it &apos;s a net-plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
it &apos;s a longer payback than mountaintop removal , but the wind energy actually pays back forever .
now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery .
the water is turned into goo .
most people are still unemployed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse , domestic abuse , teen pregnancy and poor heath , as well .
now judy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other .
not quite an obvious alliance .
i mean , they are not -- they ain &apos;t competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the endangered hillbillies . &quot;
so homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it &apos;s all about .
but just a few months ago , judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer .
yeah .
and it has since moved to her bones and her brain .
and i just find it so bizarre that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her legacy .
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
but rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something , she &apos;s leaving behind a business plan to make it happen .
that &apos;s what my homegirl is doing .
so i &apos;m so proud of that .
but these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
they &apos;re all problem solvers , and they &apos;re just some of the many examples that i really am privileged to see , meet and learn from in the examples of the work that i do now .
i was really lucky to have them all featured on my corporation for public radio radio show called thepromisedland.org.
now they &apos;re all very practical visionaries .
they take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money &apos;s flowing to meet those demands .
and when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with unemployed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
in fact , they make up some of what i call the most expensive citizens , and they include generationally impoverished , traumatized vets returning from the middle east , people coming out of jail .
and for the veterans in particular , the v.a. said there &apos;s a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003 .
i think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
and there are plenty of other examples like that .
one problem : waste handling and unemployment .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities , diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
and where is this waste handled ? usually in poor communities .
and we know that eco-industrial business , these kinds of business models -- there &apos;s a model in europe called the eco-industrial park , where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another , or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and in my hometown , we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx , but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail .
they &apos;ve since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
another problem : unhealthy food systems and unemployment .
working-class and poor urban americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system .
it relies too much on transportation , chemical fertilization , big use of water and also refrigeration .
mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land , and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity .
and so we know &quot; urban ag &quot; is a big buzz topic this time of the year , but it &apos;s mostly gardening , which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it &apos;s not in terms of creating jobs or for food production .
the numbers just aren &apos;t there .
part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city , that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities , owned and operated by small growers , where now there are only consumers .
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can &apos;t meet the year-round demand for produce .
it &apos;s not a competition with rural farm ; it &apos;s actually reinforcements .
it allies in a really positive and economically viable food system .
the goal is to meet the cities &apos; institutional demands for hospitals , senior centers , schools , daycare centers , and produce a network of regional jobs , as well .
this is smart infrastructure .
and how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day .
smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs .
and we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
so i &apos;m hoping you can see a little theme here .
these examples indicate a trend .
i haven &apos;t created it , and it &apos;s not happening by accident .
i &apos;m noticing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
and we all need to be invested in it .
it is an essential pillar to this country &apos;s recovery .
and i call it &quot; hometown security . &quot;
the recession has us reeling and fearful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very empowering .
it &apos;s a realization that we are the key to our own recovery .
now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local .
and when we do that , our neighbors -- be they next-door , or in the next state , or in the next country -- the sum of the local is the global .
hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses , putting people to work , restoring our natural systems .
hometown security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destroying it overseas .
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across america .
the challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more .
now , hometown security is about taking care of your own , but it &apos;s not like the old saying , &quot; charity begins at home . &quot;
i recently read a book called &quot; love leadership &quot; by john hope bryant .
and it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
see , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
he grew up in the segregated south , escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
and his was gambling , compulsively .
to him that phrase , &quot; charity begins at home , &quot; meant that my payday -- or someone else &apos;s -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day .
so you need to help him out .
and sometimes i would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs , and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a racetrack in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
he made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that i grew up in .
so i &apos;m not that unhappy about that .
but listen , i did feel obligated to him , and i grew up -- then i grew up .
and i &apos;m a grown woman now , and i have learned a few things along the way .
to me , charity often is just about giving , because you &apos;re supposed to , or because it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always done , or it &apos;s about giving until it hurts .
i &apos;m about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- i &apos;m not trying to feed the habit .
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
and over the past 20 years , we &apos;ve spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems , yet educational outcomes , malnutrition , incarceration , obesity , diabetes , income disparity , they &apos;ve all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular , infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it &apos;s a great world that we &apos;re bringing them into as well .
and i know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , i spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex , and i &apos;m a recovering executive director , two years clean .
but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
the greater our success , the less money came in from foundations .
and i tell you , being on the ted stage and winning a macarthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that i had arrived .
and by the time i &apos;d moved on , i was actually covering a third of my agency &apos;s budget deficit with speaking fees .
but since then , the park that was just a dump and was featured at a ted2006 talk became this little thing .
but i did in fact get married in it .
over here .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .
the south bronx greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006 .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here .
and we love this , because i love construction now , because we &apos;re watching these things actually happen .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
hometown security is next on my to-do list .
what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
we need to work together to embrace and repair our land , repair our power systems and repair ourselves .
it &apos;s time to stop building the shopping malls , the prisons , the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures .
it is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility .
thank you very much .
majora carter : 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship
the future of green is local -- and entrepreneurial . in her talk , majora carter brings us the stories of three people who are saving their own communities while saving the planet . call it &quot; hometown security . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
&quot; even in purely non-religious terms , homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty .
it is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality -- a pitiable flight from life .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness . &quot;
that &apos;s from time magazine in 1966 , when i was three years old .
and last year , the president of the united states came out in favor of gay marriage .
how did an illness become an identity ?
when i was perhaps six years old , i went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother .
and at the end of buying our shoes , the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home .
my brother wanted a red balloon , and i wanted a pink balloon .
my mother said that she thought i &apos;d really rather have a blue balloon .
but i said that i definitely wanted the pink one .
and she reminded me that my favorite color was blue .
the fact that my favorite color now is blue , but i &apos;m still gay -- -- is evidence of both my mother &apos;s influence and its limits .
when i was little , my mother used to say , &quot; the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
and when i was little , i took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me .
and when i was an adolescent , i thought that i &apos;m gay , and so i probably can &apos;t have a family .
and when she said it , it made me anxious .
and after i came out of the closet , when she continued to say it , it made me furious .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m gay . that &apos;s not the direction that i &apos;m headed in .
and i want you to stop saying that . &quot;
about 20 years ago , i was asked by my editors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about deaf culture .
and i was rather taken aback .
i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness .
those poor people , they couldn &apos;t hear .
they lacked hearing , and what could we do for them ?
and then i went out into the deaf world .
i saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry .
i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville , tennessee where people complained about that slurry southern signing .
and as i plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world , i become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said , &quot; we don &apos;t lack hearing , we have membership in a culture , &quot; were saying something that was viable .
it wasn &apos;t my culture , and i didn &apos;t particularly want to rush off and join it , but i appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it , it felt as valuable as latino culture or gay culture or jewish culture .
it felt as valid perhaps even as american culture .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me .
she was facing the question of what to do with this child .
should she say , &quot; you &apos;re just like everyone else but a little bit shorter ? &quot;
or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity , get involved in the little people of america , become aware of what was happening for dwarfs ?
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
most gay people are born to straight parents .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter .
and i thought , there it is again : a family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary .
and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
there are vertical identities , which are passed down generationally from parent to child .
those are things like ethnicity , frequently nationality , language , often religion .
those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children .
and while some of them can be difficult , there &apos;s no attempt to cure them .
you can argue that it &apos;s harder in the united states -- our current presidency notwithstanding -- to be a person of color .
there are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group .
and i call them horizontal identities , because the peer group is the horizontal experience .
these are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers .
and those identities , those horizontal identities , people have almost always tried to cure .
and i wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them .
and it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place .
there &apos;s self-acceptance , there &apos;s family acceptance , and there &apos;s social acceptance .
and they don &apos;t always coincide .
and a lot of the time , people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don &apos;t love them , when what actually has happened is that their parents don &apos;t accept them .
love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child .
but acceptance is something that takes time .
it always takes time .
one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown .
when he was born , he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism , a very disabling condition , and his parents were told that he would never walk , he would never talk , he would have no intellectual capacity , and he would probably not even recognize them .
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
and his mother said she wasn &apos;t going to do it .
and she took her son home .
and even though she didn &apos;t have a lot of educational or financial advantages , she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism , and she got clinton enrolled with him .
and in the course of his childhood , he had 30 major surgical procedures .
and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures , as a result of which he now can walk .
and while he was there , they sent tutors around to help him with his school work .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
he was the first one in his family , in fact , to go to college , where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car that accommodated his unusual body .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college nearby -- and she said , &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
&quot; and i thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet tall , he &apos;s three feet tall .
two beers for them is four beers for him . &quot;
she said , &quot; i knew i couldn &apos;t go in there and interrupt him , but i went home , and i left him eight messages on his cell phone . &quot;
she said , &quot; and then i thought , if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he &apos;d go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- &quot; and i said to her , &quot; what do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming , accomplished , wonderful person ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; what did i do ? i loved him , that &apos;s all .
clinton just always had that light in him .
and his father and i were lucky enough to be the first to see it there . &quot;
i &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 60s .
this one is from 1968 -- the atlantic monthly , voice of liberal america -- written by an important bioethicist .
he said , &quot; there is no reason to feel guilty about putting a down syndrome child away , whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible , lethal sense .
it is sad , yes -- dreadful . but it carries no guilt .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
the fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day .
but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences , how we used to see people who were disabled , how inhuman we held people to be .
and the change that &apos;s been accomplished there , which is almost equally radical , is one that we pay not very much attention to .
one of the families i interviewed , tom and karen robards , were taken aback when , as young and successful new yorkers , their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome .
they thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be , and so they decided they would build a little center -- two classrooms that they started with a few other parents -- to educate kids with d.s.
and over the years , that center grew into something called the cooke center , where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught .
in the time since that atlantic monthly story ran , the life expectancy for people with down syndrome has tripled .
the robards had a lot to do with that .
and i said , &quot; do you regret it ?
do you wish your child didn &apos;t have down syndrome ?
do you wish you &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;
and interestingly his father said , &quot; well , for david , our son , i regret it , because for david , it &apos;s a difficult way to be in the world , and i &apos;d like to give david an easier life .
but i think if we lost everyone with down syndrome , it would be a catastrophic loss . &quot;
and karen robards said to me , &quot; i &apos;m with tom .
for david , i would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life .
but speaking for myself -- well , i would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point -- speaking for myself , it &apos;s made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life , that speaking for myself , i wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything in the world . &quot;
we live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up .
and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before .
most deaf infants born in the united states now will receive cochlear implants , which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver , and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech .
a compound that has been tested in mice , bmn-111 , is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene .
achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism , and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene , grow to full size .
testing in humans is around the corner .
there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies , or to terminate them .
and so we have both social progress and medical progress .
and i believe in both of them .
i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful , and i think the same thing about the medical progress .
but i think it &apos;s a tragedy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
and when i see the way they &apos;re intersecting in conditions like the three i &apos;ve just described , i sometimes think it &apos;s like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan .
we have to think about how we feel about cures altogether .
jim sinclair , a prominent autism activist , said , &quot; when parents say &apos; i wish my child did not have autism , &apos; what they &apos;re really saying is &apos; i wish the child i have did not exist and i had a different , non-autistic child instead . &apos; read that again . this is what we hear when you mourn over our existence .
this is what we hear when you pray for a cure -- that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
it &apos;s a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don &apos;t want to be cured or changed or eliminated .
they want to be whoever it is that they &apos;ve come to be .
one of the families i interviewed for this project was the family of dylan klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the columbine massacre .
it took a long time to persuade them to talk to me , and once they agreed , they were so full of their story that they couldn &apos;t stop telling it .
and the first weekend i spent with them -- the first of many -- i recorded more than 20 hours of conversation .
and on sunday night , we were all exhausted .
we were sitting in the kitchen . sue klebold was fixing dinner .
and i said , &quot; if dylan were here now , do you have a sense of what you &apos;d want to ask him ? &quot;
and his father said , &quot; i sure do .
i &apos;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing . &quot;
and sue looked at the floor , and she thought for a minute .
and then she looked back up and said , &quot; i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
when i had dinner with her a couple of years later -- one of many dinners that we had together -- she said , &quot; you know , when it first happened , i used to wish that i had never married , that i had never had children .
if i hadn &apos;t gone to ohio state and crossed paths with tom , this child wouldn &apos;t have existed and this terrible thing wouldn &apos;t have happened .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; she said .
&quot; so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born , i &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems , problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid , and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting .
and then i thought , all of us who have children love the children we have , with their flaws .
if some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children i have and give me other , better children -- more polite , funnier , nicer , smarter -- i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle .
it turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed -- there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia , there are only so many families of children who are transgender , there are only so many families of prodigies -- who also face similar challenges in many ways -- there are only so many families in each of those categories -- but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing , then you discover that it &apos;s a nearly universal phenomenon .
ironically , it turns out , that it &apos;s our differences , and our negotiation of difference , that unite us .
i decided to have children while i was working on this project .
and many people were astonished and said , &quot; but how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m not studying everything that can go wrong .
what i &apos;m studying is how much love there can be , even when everything appears to be going wrong . &quot;
i thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child i had seen , a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect .
and when his ashes were interred , his mother said , &quot; i pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed , once of the child i wanted and once of the son i loved . &quot;
and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
so my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in minneapolis .
i had a close friend from college who &apos;d gone through a divorce and wanted to have children .
and so she and i have a daughter , and mother and daughter live in texas .
and my husband and i have a son who lives with us all the time of whom i am the biological father , and our surrogate for the pregnancy was laura , the lesbian mother of oliver and lucy in minneapolis .
so the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
and i don &apos;t accept subtractive models of love , only additive ones .
and i believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on , so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness .
the day after our son was born , the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
he wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
in so far as he was extending them , he was doing so asymmetrically , which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action .
and as she told me all of these things , i felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor .
and i thought , here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled , and i didn &apos;t want to join their number .
because what i was encountering was an idea of illness .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , i wanted to protect my child from illness .
and i wanted also to protect myself from illness .
and yet , i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for , that those would ultimately be his identity , and if they were his identity they would become my identity , that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded .
we took him to the mri machine , we took him to the cat scanner , we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw .
we felt helpless .
and at the end of five hours , they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly .
and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on , she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp .
but i thought how my mother was right .
i thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
i think children had ensnared me the moment i connected fatherhood with loss .
but i &apos;m not sure i would have noticed that if i hadn &apos;t been so in the thick of this research project of mine .
i &apos;d encountered so much strange love , and i fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns .
and i saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities .
during these 10 years , i had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility , and i had come to see how it conquers everything else .
and while i had sometimes thought the parents i was interviewing were fools , enslaving themselves to a lifetime &apos;s journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery , i realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that i was ready to join them on their ship .
thank you .
andrew solomon : love , no matter what
what is it like to raise a child who &apos;s different from you in some fundamental way ? in this quietly moving talk , writer andrew solomon shares what he learned from talking to dozens of parents -- asking them : what &apos;s the line between unconditional love and unconditional acceptance ?
most people don &apos;t know that when i went to high school in this country -- i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculptor .
my family was wealthy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted .
and i announced i wanted to be a sculptor in paris .
and he was a clever man . he sort of said , &quot; well , that &apos;s ok , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math sats . &quot;
in fact , i &apos;d got an 800 . and he thought i did very well -- and i did , too -- in the arts : this was my passion .
and he said &quot; if you go to mit , &quot; to which i had been given early admission , &quot; i will pay for every year you &apos;re at mit , in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris . &quot;
and i thought that was the best deal in town , so i accepted it immediately .
and i decided that if i was good in art , and i was good in mathematics , i &apos;d study architecture , which was the blending of the two .
i went and told my headmaster that , at prep school .
and i said to him what i was doing , that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together .
he said to me something that just went completely over my head .
he said , &quot; you know , i like grey suits , and i like pin-striped suits , but i don &apos;t like grey pin-striped suits . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; what a turkey this guy is , &quot; and i went off to mit .
i studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t architecture .
that really , the mixing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjoyed a career doing that .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim citrin &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab passing the baton on , i thought , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project .
something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had . &quot;
and in the case of the media lab , knowing a lot of people , knowing people who were either executives or wealthy , and also not having , in my own case , a career to worry about anymore .
my career , i mean , i &apos;d done my career .
didn &apos;t have to worry about earning money .
didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
and i said , &quot; boy , let &apos;s really do something that takes advantage of all these features , &quot; and thought that if we could address education , by leveraging the children , and bringing to the world the access of the computers , that that was really the thing we should do .
it &apos;s taken at three o &apos;clock in the morning , without the permission of the company .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re stacked up .
those are conveyor belts that go around .
this is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by , but then you &apos;ll see the ones up above .
what happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
but you &apos;ve got to have the thing moving on the assembly line , because it &apos;s constant .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
this picture was taken in 1982 , just before the ibm pc was even announced .
seymour papert and i were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself .
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .
and when people tell me , &quot; who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
i say to myself , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room -- i don &apos;t care how techie you are -- there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . ok ?
we all need help , even those of us who are very seasoned .
this picture of seymour -- 25 years ago . seymour made a very simple observation in 1968 , and then basically presented it in 1970 -- april 11 to be precise -- called &quot; teaching children thinking . &quot;
what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they debug the programs , they come the closest to learning about learning .
that was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that .
kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything i hope this brings back , it &apos;s programming to kids .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
this is being launched with three languages in it : squeak , logo , and a third , that i &apos;ve never even seen before .
this photograph is very important because it &apos;s much later .
this is in the early 2000s . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what spirited this , plus the influence of joe and others . we started one laptop per child .
this is the same village in cambodia , just a couple of months ago .
these kids are real pros . there were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids . being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental .
everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit , but they were all wrong .
and the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold .
there are many reasons , but the two that merit the little bit of time is : one , the clarity of purpose is there . the moral purpose is clear .
i can see any head of state , any executive i want , at any time , because i &apos;m not selling laptops . ok ? i have no shareholders .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference whatsoever .
the clarity of purpose is absolutely critical . and the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world .
if you look at our professional services , including search firms , including communications , including legal services , including banking , they &apos;re all pro bono . and it &apos;s not to save money .
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
we couldn &apos;t afford to hire a cfo . we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary , and we had a queue of people .
it allows you to team up with people . the u.n. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos;re profit making . so announcing this with kofi annan was very important , and the u.n. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . and this was the machine we were showing before i met yves behar .
and while this machine in some sense is silly , in retrospect , it actually served a very important purpose .
that pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody .
everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank . it &apos;s different .
it was getting its power in a different way . it &apos;s kind of childlike .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
in spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
i didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better off-board .
and then , i could tell you lots about the laptop , but i decided on just four things .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
that computer is unlike anything you &apos;ve had , and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don &apos;t come close to . and it &apos;s very important to be low power , and i hope that &apos;s picked up more by the industry .
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
dual-mode display -- that sunlight display &apos;s fantastic .
we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight , and the more sunlight the better .
and that was really critical . the mesh network , it &apos;ll become commonplace .
and of course , &quot; rugged &quot; goes without saying .
and the reason i think design matters isn &apos;t because i wanted to go to art school .
and by the way , when i graduated from mit , i thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to paris for six years .
so , i didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product .
most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
and , in english , the word &quot; cheap &quot; has a double meaning , which is really appropriate , because it &apos;s cheap , in the pejorative sense , as well as inexpensive .
but if you take a different approach , and you think of very large-scale integration , very advanced materials , very advanced manufacturing -- so you &apos;re pouring chemicals in one end , ipods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design , that &apos;s what we wanted to do .
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn &apos;t compare notes .
these are his slides , and so i don &apos;t have to talk about them .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
yves showed one of the power-generating devices .
the mesh network , the reason i -- and i won &apos;t go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world , they &apos;re connected . there &apos;s not just laptops .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
if you &apos;re in the jungle , it &apos;s about 500 meters . so if a kid bicycles home , or walks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the grid , so to speak .
they &apos;re not going to be near another laptop , so you have to nail these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
you don &apos;t call verizon or sprint . you build your own network .
and that &apos;s very important , the user interface .
we are launching with 18 keyboards . english is by far the minority .
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
i &apos;m willing to suspect some of you hadn &apos;t even heard of them before .
is there anybody in the room , one person , unless you work with olpc , is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that &apos;s on the screen ? there &apos;s only one hand -- so you get it .
yes , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s right . it &apos;s amharic , it &apos;s ethiopian . in ethiopia , there &apos;s never been a keyboard .
there is no keyboard standard because there &apos;s no market .
and this is the big difference .
again , when you &apos;re a nonprofit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
so we went to ethiopia , and we helped them make a keyboard .
and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard .
so what i want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . i decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now -- is to go to six countries .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it &apos;s rich .
here &apos;s the six . we went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million .
we thought , this is exactly the right strategy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries .
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
in each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
this was a period in my life where i was traveling 330 days per year .
in the case of libya , it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent .
the camel smells were unbelievable .
and it was 45 degrees c. i mean , this was not what you &apos;d call a cool experience . and former countries -- i say former , because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press release .
so we went to smaller ones . uruguay , bless their hearts .
small country , not so rich . president said he &apos;d do it , and guess what ?
he did do it . the tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sunlight-readable , mesh-network , low-power , but just a vanilla laptop proposal .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay , the first 100,000 , boom , went to olpc .
the next day -- the next day , not even 24 hours had passed -- in peru , the president of peru said , &quot; we &apos;ll do 250 . &quot; and boom , a little domino effect .
the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it .
the president of ethiopia said he would do it .
and boom , boom , boom . the president of mongolia .
and so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries -- still not enough .
add up all those countries , it didn &apos;t quite get to thing , so we said , &quot; let &apos;s start a program in the united states . &quot; so , end of august , early september , we decide to do this . we announced it near the middle , end -- just when the clinton initiative was taking place .
we thought that was a good time to announce it .
launched it on the 12 of november .
we said it would be just for a short period until the 26 . we &apos;ve extended it until the 31 .
and the &quot; give one , get one &quot; program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested .
the first day it was just wild . and then we said , &quot; well , let &apos;s get people to give many . not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . &quot; and that &apos;s where you come in .
and that &apos;s where i think it &apos;s very important . i don &apos;t want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops . okay ? do it , but that &apos;s not going to help . okay ?
if everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars , whatever it is , 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah , great .
i want you do something else .
tell people about it ! it &apos;s got to become viral , ok ?
use your mailing lists . people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .
get your friends to give one , get one .
and if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
i won &apos;t dwell on the pricing at all .
just to say that when you do the &quot; give one , get one , &quot; a lot of press is a bit about , &quot; they didn &apos;t make it , it &apos;s 188 dollars , it &apos;s not 100 . &quot;
it will be 100 in two years . it will go below 100 .
we &apos;ve pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
but it was the countries that wanted it to go up , and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons . so what you can do -- i &apos;ve just said it . don &apos;t just give one , get one .
i just want to end with one last one . this one is not even 24-hours old , or maybe it &apos;s 24-hours .
the first kids got their laptops . they got them by ship , and i &apos;m talking now about 7,000 , 8,000 at a time went out this week .
they went to uruguay , peru , mexico .
and it &apos;s been slow coming , and we &apos;re only making about 5,000 a week , but we hope , we hope , sometime in next year , maybe by the middle of the year , to hit a million a month . now put that number , and a million isn &apos;t so much . it &apos;s not a big number .
we &apos;re selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
but a million a month in laptop-land is a big number .
and the world production today , everybody combined , making laptops , is five million a month . so i &apos;m standing here telling you that sometime next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world production .
and if we do that , there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there .
and we hope if you have eg two years from now , or whenever you have it again , i won &apos;t have bad breath , and i will be invited back , and will have , hopefully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children .
thank you .
nicholas negroponte : one laptop per child , two years on
nicholas negroponte talks about how one laptop per child is doing , two years in . speaking at the eg conference while the first xo laptops roll off the production line , he recaps the controversies and recommits to the goals of this far-reaching project .
i , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on earth who live in cities .
and some days , that can even be a little scary .
but what i &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
a couple of years ago , i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
now at the time that i was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment .
so i was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future .
but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article -- was it &apos;s precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system .
so , i happen to know a little bit from my own work about how nasa has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space .
and you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants &apos; root systems .
now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
fast-forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors .
and the way it works is that there &apos;s a pump at the bottom , which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top , which then trickles down through plants &apos; root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there &apos;s no dirt involved .
now light and temperature vary with each window &apos;s microclimate , so a window farm requires a farmer , and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organically .
back at the time , a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing .
and i really wanted it to be an open project , because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now and could possibly become another area like monsanto , where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people &apos;s food .
so i decided that , instead of creating a product , what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers .
the first few systems that we created , they kind of worked .
we were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical new york city apartment window .
and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers , all kinds of stuff .
but the first few systems were these leaky , loud power-guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved .
so to bring on more co-developers , what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs , we explained how they worked , and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems .
and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
and we have window farms all over the world .
what we &apos;re doing is what nasa or a large corporation would call r &amp; amp ; d , or research and development .
but what we call it is r &amp; amp ; d-i-y , or research and develop it yourself .
so for example , jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps .
it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right , but once we did , we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half .
tony in chicago has been taking on growing experiments , like lots of other window farmers , and he &apos;s been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients .
and window farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they &apos;re now making open source and part of the project .
so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software .
and with every open source project , the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns .
so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
so for do-it-yourselfers , we provide free , very well-tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free .
and there &apos;s a patent pending on these systems as well that &apos;s held by the community .
and to fund the project , we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don &apos;t have time to build their own systems .
now within our community , a certain culture has appeared .
in our culture , it is better to be a tester who supports someone else &apos;s idea than it is to be just the idea guy .
what we get out of this project is we get support for our own work , as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs .
but i think that eileen expresses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration .
so she expresses here what it &apos;s like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea , built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that r &amp; amp ; d-i-y has moved beyond just window farms and leds into solar panels and aquaponic systems .
and we &apos;re looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now .
so we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united , and to declare that we are all still pioneers .
britta riley : a garden in my apartment
britta riley wanted to grow her own food . so she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in discarded plastic bottles -- researching , testing and tweaking the system using social media , trying many variations at once and quickly arriving at the optimal system . call it distributed diy . and the results ? delicious . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so a friend of mine who &apos;s a political scientist , he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like .
he said , you know , there &apos;s this fiscal cliff coming , it &apos;s going to come at the beginning of 2013 .
both parties absolutely need to resolve it , but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it .
neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it &apos;s due , so he said , december , you &apos;re just going to see lots of angry negotiations , negotiations breaking apart , reports of phone calls that aren &apos;t going well , people saying nothing &apos;s happening at all , and then sometime around christmas or new year &apos;s , we &apos;re going to hear , &quot; okay , they resolved everything . &quot;
he told me that a few months ago . he said he &apos;s 98 percent positive they &apos;re going to resolve it , and i got an email from him today saying , all right , we &apos;re basically on track , but now i &apos;m 80 percent positive that they &apos;re going to resolve it .
and it made me think . i love studying these moments in american history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger , that the economy was on the verge of total collapse .
the most famous early battle was alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up , with alexander hamilton saying , &quot; we need a central bank , the first bank of the united states , or else the dollar will have no value .
this economy won &apos;t work , &quot; and thomas jefferson saying , &quot; the people won &apos;t trust that .
they just fought off a king . they &apos;re not going to accept some central authority . &quot;
this battle defined the first 150 years of the u.s. economy , and at every moment , different partisans saying , &quot; oh my god , the economy &apos;s about to collapse , &quot; and the rest of us just going about , spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy .
to give you a quick primer on where we are , a quick refresher on where we are .
so the fiscal cliff , i was told that that &apos;s too partisan a thing to say , although i can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s supporting or attacking .
people say we should call it the fiscal slope , or we should call it an austerity crisis , but then other people say , no , that &apos;s even more partisan .
so i just call it the self-imposed , self-destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem .
and this is what the inevitable problem looks like .
so this is a projection of u.s. debt as a percentage of our overall economy , of gdp .
the light blue dotted line represents the congressional budget office &apos;s best guess of what will happen if congress really doesn &apos;t do anything , and as you can see , sometime around 2027 , we reach greek levels of debt , somewhere around 130 percent of gdp , which tells you that some time in the next 20 years , if congress does absolutely nothing , we &apos;re going to hit a moment where the world &apos;s investors , the world &apos;s bond buyers , are going to say , &quot; we don &apos;t trust america anymore . we &apos;re not going to lend them any money , except at really high interest rates . &quot;
and at that moment our economy collapses .
we &apos;re there in 20 years . we have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis , and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis .
the dark blue line is how much the government spends .
the light blue line is how much the government gets in .
and as you can see , for most of recent history , except for a brief period , we have consistently spent more than we take in . thus the national debt .
but as you can also see , projected going forward , the gap widens a bit and raises a bit , and this graph is only through 2021 .
it gets really , really ugly out towards 2030 .
the democrats , they say , well , this isn &apos;t a big deal .
we can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap , especially if we raise taxes on the rich .
the republicans say , hey , no , no , we &apos;ve got a better idea .
why don &apos;t we lower both lines ?
why don &apos;t we lower government spending and lower government taxes , and then we &apos;ll be on an even more favorable long-term deficit trajectory ?
and behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap , there &apos;s the worst kind of cynical party politics , the worst kind of insider baseball , lobbying , all of that stuff , but there &apos;s also this powerfully interesting , respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies .
and i like to think , when i picture how republicans see the economy , what i picture is just some amazingly well-engineered machine , some perfect machine .
unfortunately , i picture it made in germany or japan , but this amazing machine that &apos;s constantly scouring every bit of human endeavor and taking resources , money , labor , capital , machinery , away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts , and while this might cause temporary dislocation , what it does is it builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and die , and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient , so much richer for everybody .
and this view generally believes that there is a role for government , a small role , to set the rules so people aren &apos;t lying and cheating and hurting each other , maybe , you know , have a police force and a fire department and an army , but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery .
and when i picture how democrats and democratic-leaning economists picture this economy , most democratic economists are , you know , they &apos;re capitalists , they believe , yes , that &apos;s a good system a lot of the time .
it &apos;s good to let markets move resources to their more productive use .
but that system has tons of problems .
wealth piles up in the wrong places .
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called unproductive .
that &apos;s not going to create an equitable , fair society .
that machine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about racism , about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us , and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses , or from richer sources , and give them to other sources .
and i can get really despairing . i &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this , until this year , i learned something that i felt really excited about . i feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so shocking , i don &apos;t like saying it , because i think people won &apos;t believe me .
but here &apos;s what i learned .
the american people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issues , to fiscal issues , are moderate , pragmatic centrists .
and i know that &apos;s hard to believe , that the american people are moderate , pragmatic centrists .
but let me explain what i &apos;m thinking .
when you look at how the federal government spends money , so this is the battle right here , 55 percent , more than half , is on social security , medicare , medicaid , a few other health programs , 20 percent defense , 19 percent discretionary , and six percent interest .
so when we &apos;re talking about cutting government spending , this is the pie we &apos;re talking about , and americans overwhelmingly , and it doesn &apos;t matter what party they &apos;re in , overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk .
they like social security . they like medicare .
they even like medicaid , even though that goes to the poor and indigent , which you might think would have less support .
and they do not want it fundamentally touched , although the american people are remarkably comfortable , and democrats roughly equal to republicans , with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable .
social security is fairly easy to fix .
the rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated .
so gradually raise social security retirement age , maybe only on people not yet born .
americans are about 50 / 50 , whether they &apos;re democrats or republicans .
reduce medicare for very wealthy seniors , seniors who make a lot of money . don &apos;t even eliminate it . just reduce it .
people generally are comfortable with it , democrats and republicans .
everyone hates that equally , but republicans and democrats hate that together .
and so what this tells me is , when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems , we are not a nation that &apos;s powerfully divided on the major , major issue .
we &apos;re comfortable with it needing some tweaks , but we want to keep it .
now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we don &apos;t care , spend some more , and that of course is republicans when it comes to military defense spending .
they way outweigh democrats .
the vast majority want to protect military defense spending .
i should also note that the &#91; discretionary &#93; spending , which is about 19 percent of the budget , that is democratic and republican issues , so you do have welfare , food stamps , other programs that tend to be popular among democrats , but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of department of interior inducements for oil drilling and other things , which tend to be popular among republicans .
now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
that &apos;s a more partisan area .
you have democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year , republicans sort of against it , although if you break it out by income , republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea .
so basically republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don &apos;t want to be taxed .
raising taxes on investment income , you also see about two thirds of democrats but only one third of republicans are comfortable with that idea .
this brings up a really important point , which is that we tend in this country to talk about democrats and republicans and think there &apos;s this little group over there called independents that &apos;s , what , two percent ?
if you add democrats , you add republicans , you &apos;ve got the american people .
but that is not the case at all .
and it has not been the case for most of modern american history .
roughly a third of americans say that they are democrats .
around a quarter say that they are republicans .
a tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians , or socialists , or some other small third party , and the largest block , 40 percent , say they &apos;re independents .
so most americans are not partisan , and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between , so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of democrats and republicans , we have even more overlap when you add in the independents .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
we get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment , but on these fiscal issues , these important fiscal issues , we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say .
and in fact , there &apos;s this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think , and that group is economists .
i talk to a lot of economists , and back in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s it was ugly being an economist .
you were in what they called the saltwater camp , meaning harvard , princeton , mit , stanford , berkeley , or you were in the freshwater camp , university of chicago , university of rochester .
you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a keynesian liberal economist , and these people didn &apos;t go to each other &apos;s weddings , they snubbed each other at conferences .
it &apos;s still ugly to this day , but in my experience , it is really , really hard to find an economist under 40 who still has that kind of way of seeing the world .
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
i go by the data . &quot;
and the data is very clear .
none of these major theories have been completely successful .
the 20th century , the last hundred years , is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful , awful job , so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty .
they still are an awfully arrogant group of people , i will assure you , but they &apos;re now arrogant about their impartiality , and they , too , see a tremendous range of potential outcomes .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey american political attitudes : pew research , the university of chicago &apos;s national opinion research center , and the most important but the least known is the american national election studies group that is the world &apos;s longest , most respected poll of political attitudes .
they &apos;ve been doing it since 1948 , and what they show consistently throughout is that it &apos;s almost impossible to find americans who are consistent ideologically , who consistently support , &quot; no we mustn &apos;t tax , and we must limit the size of government , &quot; or , &quot; no , we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism . &quot;
those groups are very , very small .
the vast majority of people , they pick and choose , they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument .
and that part of it has not changed .
what has changed is how people respond to vague questions .
if you ask people vague questions , like , &quot; do you think there should be more government or less government ? &quot;
&quot; do you think government should &quot; — especially if you use loaded language -- &quot; do you think the government should provide handouts ? &quot;
or , &quot; do you think the government should redistribute ? &quot;
then you can see radical partisan change .
but when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration , people are remarkably centrist , they &apos;re remarkably open to compromise .
so what we have , then , when you think about the fiscal cliff , don &apos;t think of it as the american people fundamentally can &apos;t stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations .
think of it as a tiny , tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process .
and they &apos;ve captured the process through familiar ways , through a primary system which encourages that small group of people &apos;s voices , because that small group of people , the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions , they might be small but every one of them has a blog , every one of them has been on fox or msnbc in the last week .
every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice , but they don &apos;t represent us .
they don &apos;t represent what our views are .
and that gets me back to the dollar , and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience .
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton .
in 1913 , we had this ugly battle over the federal reserve , when it was created , with vicious , angry arguments over how it would be constituted , and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise , a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing , this dollar , but then everyone agreeing , okay , so long as we &apos;re on the gold standard , it should be okay .
the fed can &apos;t mess it up so badly .
but then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international currency coordination during richard nixon &apos;s presidency .
each of those times , we were on the verge of complete collapse .
and nothing happened at all .
throughout it all , the dollar has been one of the most long-standing , stable , reasonable currencies , and we all use it every single day , no matter what the people screaming about tell us , no matter how scared we &apos;re supposed to be .
and this long-term fiscal picture that we &apos;re in right now , i think what is most maddening about it is , if congress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other , not that they &apos;re able to come up with the best possible compromise , but that they are able to just begin the process towards compromise , we all instantly are better off .
the fear is that the world is watching .
the fear is that the longer we delay any solution , the more the world will look to the u.s.
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy , but as a place that can &apos;t resolve its own fights , and the longer we put that off , the more we make the world nervous , the higher interest rates are going to be , the quicker we &apos;re going to have to face a day of horrible calamity .
and so just the act of compromise itself , and sustained , real compromise , would give us even more time , would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road .
so i &apos;m in the media . i feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise , to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us , but to just talk about it like what it is , not an existential crisis , not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views , but a math problem , a really solvable math problem , one where we &apos;re not all going to get what we want and one where , you know , there &apos;s going to be a little pain to spread around .
but the more we address it as a practical concern , the sooner we can resolve it , and the more time we have to resolve it , paradoxically .
thank you .
adam davidson : what we learned from teetering on the fiscal cliff
at the end of 2012 , the us political system was headed for the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; -- a budget impasse that could only be solved with bipartisan agreement . adam davidson , cohost of &quot; planet money , &quot; shares surprising data on how bipartisan we truly are -- and hints at the disconnect between representatives and the people they represent .
when i was little -- and by the way , i was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker .
and what this guy had done : he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches .
and one day , one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he &apos;d bought .
and the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels .
and as he did so , his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving , were words .
and the watchmaker turned around and said , &quot; god can see it . &quot;
now i &apos;m not in the least bit religious , neither was my father , but at that point , i noticed something happening here .
i felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves , and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere , i guess .
but i felt something .
and it was a physiological response .
and from that point on , from my age at the time , i began to think of things in a different way .
and as i took on my career as a designer , i began to ask myself the simple question : do we actually think beauty , or do we feel it ?
now you probably know the answer to this already .
you probably think , well , i don &apos;t know which one you think it is , but i think it &apos;s about feeling beauty .
and so i then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things .
one of the most early work was done in automotive design -- some very exciting work was done there .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
do you remember when lights used to just go on and off , click click , when you closed the door in a car ?
and then somebody , i think it was bmw , introduced a light that went out slowly .
i remember it clearly .
do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that ?
i remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
in fact , i &apos;ve never found anybody that doesn &apos;t like the light that goes out slowly .
i thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
so i started to ask myself questions about it .
and the first was , i &apos;d ask other people : &quot; do you like it ? &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; and they &apos;d say , &quot; oh , it feels so natural , &quot; or , &quot; it &apos;s nice . &quot;
can we cut down a little bit further , because , as a designer , i need the vocabulary , i need the keyboard , of how this actually works .
and so i did some experiments .
and i suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that -- light to dark in six seconds -- exactly that .
do you know what it is ? anyone ?
you see , using this bit , the thinky bit , the slow bit of the brain -- using that .
and this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
and would you do me a favor ?
for the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ?
i don &apos;t need you to think so much as i want you to feel it .
i felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation .
and that thing that i found was the cinema or the theater .
it &apos;s actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
and when that happens , are you sitting there going , &quot; no , the movie &apos;s about to start , &quot; or are you going , &quot; that &apos;s fantastic . i &apos;m looking forward to it .
now i &apos;m not a neuroscientist .
i don &apos;t know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex .
but it might be .
because the people i speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this .
and some of the people i speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don &apos;t get it in the same way .
everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
so this leads me to think of this in a different way .
we &apos;re not feeling it . we &apos;re thinking beauty is in the limbic system -- if that &apos;s not an outmoded idea .
these are the bits , the pleasure centers , and maybe what i &apos;m seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking .
they arrive first .
so how do we make that actually work ?
and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know , or what we &apos;re going to learn , about something ?
this is one of the most beautiful things i know .
it &apos;s a plastic bag .
and when i looked at it first , i thought , no , there &apos;s no beauty in that .
then i found out , post exposure , that this plastic bag if i put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff , that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure , potable drinking water .
and all of a sudden , this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me .
now i &apos;m going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit .
would you mind taking the brain out , and i just want you to feel something .
look at that . what are you feeling about it ?
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
i &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
there &apos;s some rather bored-looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged-looking ladies who are picking up something off that .
maybe there &apos;s an innocence to it .
now i &apos;m going to tell you what it is . are you ready ?
this is the last act on this earth of a little girl called heidi , five years old , before she died of cancer to the spine .
it &apos;s the last thing she did , the last physical act .
look at that picture .
look at the innocence . look at the beauty in it .
is it beautiful now ?
stop . stop . how do you feel ?
i &apos;m feeling it here . i feel it here .
and i &apos;m watching your faces , because your faces are telling me something .
the lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
but what are you doing ?
i watch what people do .
i watch faces .
i watch reactions .
because i have to know how people react to things .
and one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty , something stupefyingly delicious , is what i call the omg .
and by the way , there &apos;s no pleasure in that face .
it &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
the eyebrows are doing this , the eyes are defocused , and the mouth is hanging open .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
there &apos;s something else in that .
there &apos;s something weird happening .
so pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in .
poignancy is a word i love as a designer .
it means something triggering a big emotional response , often quite a sad emotional response , but it &apos;s part of what we do .
it isn &apos;t just about nice .
and this is the dilemma , this is the paradox , of beauty .
sensorily , we &apos;re taking in all sorts of things -- mixtures of things that are good , bad , exciting , frightening -- to come up with that sensorial exposure , that sensation of what &apos;s going on .
pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl &apos;s drawing .
and that &apos;s packed in there as well .
and as we assemble these tools , from a design point of view , i get terribly excited about it , because these are things , as we &apos;ve already said , they &apos;re arriving at the brain , it would seem , before cognition , before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks .
now what i &apos;m also interested in is : is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty ?
by that , i mean intrinsically beautiful things , just something that &apos;s exquisitely beautiful , that &apos;s universally beautiful .
very hard to find something that , to everybody , is a very beautiful thing , without a certain amount of information packed in there before .
it &apos;s mediated by information before the comprehension .
or the information &apos;s added on at the back , like that little girl &apos;s drawing that i showed you .
now when talking about beauty you can &apos;t get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you .
and one of the most tedious ones , i think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry .
well it obviously isn &apos;t .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face .
and they found that it was almost exact coincidence .
so it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
in fact , this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face , of which both sides are beautiful .
but they &apos;re both different .
and as a designer , i can &apos;t help meddling with this , so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as i go .
now i can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye .
i &apos;m not getting it off the eyebrow .
and the earhole isn &apos;t doing it to me at all .
so i don &apos;t know how much this is helping me , but it &apos;s helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off .
and as i say , i &apos;m not a neuroscientist , but to understand how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements .
anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are , but as we are .
and this is the f1 mv agusta .
ahhhh .
it is really -- i mean , i can &apos;t express to you how exquisite this object is .
but i also know why it &apos;s exquisite to me , because it &apos;s a palimpsest of things .
it &apos;s masses and masses of layers .
this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
it &apos;s something much bigger .
layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate .
i mean , if i just go through some of them now -- i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects , and that does it consummately well , you can see it can .
so that &apos;s getting me excited .
and i feel that here .
this bit , the big secret of automotive design -- reflection management .
it &apos;s not about the shapes , it &apos;s how the shapes reflect light .
now that thing , light flickers across it as you move , so it becomes a kinetic object , even though it &apos;s standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that &apos;s done on the reflection .
this little relief on the footplate , by the way , to a rider means there &apos;s something going on underneath it -- in this case , a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably , taking the power from the engine .
i &apos;m getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things .
titanium lacquer on this .
i can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
that &apos;s how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel .
i &apos;m really getting into this now .
and of course , a racing bike doesn &apos;t have a prop stand , but this one , because it &apos;s a road bike , it all goes away and it folds into this little gap .
so it disappears .
why would you do that ?
because i know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics .
so it &apos;s more expensive , but it &apos;s wonderful .
and to cap it all , brand royalty -- agusta , count agusta , from the great histories of this stuff .
the bit that you can &apos;t see is the genius that created this .
massimo tamburini .
they call him &quot; the plumber &quot; in italy , as well as &quot; maestro , &quot; because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time .
there &apos;s so little compromise on this , you can &apos;t see it .
but unfortunately , the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty .
we have to deal with it .
so i have to work with a supply chain , and i &apos;ve got to work with the technologies , and i &apos;ve got to work with everything else all the time , and so compromises start to fit into it .
and so look at her .
i &apos;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
no one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
did you see what i did ?
i moved three things by a millimeter .
pretty ? yes .
beautiful ? maybe lesser .
but then , of course , the consumer says that doesn &apos;t really matter .
so that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
another millimeter ?
it &apos;s that easy to lose beauty , because beauty &apos;s incredibly difficult to do .
and only a few people can do it .
and a focus group cannot do it .
and a team rarely can do it .
it takes a central cortex , if you like , to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time .
this is a beautiful water bottle -- some of you know of it -- done by ross lovegrove , the designer .
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
it &apos;s lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious .
i might like it more than you like it , because i know how bloody hard it is to do it .
it &apos;s stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that , that comes out of the tool correctly , that goes down the line without falling over .
underneath this , like the story of the swan , is a million things very difficult to do .
so all hail to that .
it &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one .
and they &apos;re working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it .
you all , i guess , like me , enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance .
and part of the joy of it is , you know the difficulty .
you also may be taking into account the fact that it &apos;s incredibly painful .
anybody seen a ballet dancer &apos;s toes when they come out of the points ?
while she &apos;s doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you , something horrible &apos;s going on down here .
the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what &apos;s actually going on .
now i &apos;m using microseconds wrongly here , so please ignore me .
so we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
right , are you ready ? i &apos;m going to show you something for a very , very brief moment .
are you ready ? okay .
did you think that was a bicycle when i showed it to you at the first flash ?
it &apos;s not .
tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? yes you did .
did you think it was modern ? yes you did .
that blip , that information , shot into you before that .
and because your brain starter motor began there , now it &apos;s got to deal with it .
and the great thing is , this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it &apos;s green technology and it &apos;s good for you and it &apos;s light and it &apos;s all part of the future .
so is that wrong ?
well in this case it isn &apos;t , because it &apos;s a very , very ecologically-sound piece of technology .
but you &apos;re a slave of that first flash .
we are slaves to the first few fractions of a second -- and that &apos;s where much of my work has to win or lose , on a shelf in a shop .
it wins or loses at that point .
you may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it , but i have to work within that domain , to ensure that it gets you there first .
and finally , the layer that i love , of knowledge .
some of you , i &apos;m sure , will be familiar with this .
what &apos;s incredible about this , and the way i love to come back to it , is this is taking something that you hate or bores you , folding clothes , and if you can actually do this -- who can actually do this ? anybody try to do this ?
yeah ?
it &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
look at that . do you want to see it again ?
but just go to the web , youtube , pull it down , &quot; folding t-shirt . &quot;
that &apos;s how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your t-shirt .
you didn &apos;t maybe know it .
but how do you feel about it ?
it feels fantastic when you do it , you look forward to doing it , and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart .
the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out ?
form follows function ?
only sometimes . only sometimes .
form is function . form is function .
it informs , it tells us , it supplies us answers before we &apos;ve even thought about it .
and so i &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; form , &quot; and i &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; function &quot; as a designer .
what i try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things .
because if i can get that right , i can make them wonderful , and i can make them repeatedly wonderful .
and you know what those products and services are , because you own some of them .
they &apos;re the things that you &apos;d snatch if the house was on fire .
forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
richard seymour : how beauty feels
a story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? and why does it matter so much to us ? designer richard seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it .
one of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don &apos;t -- into the religious and the atheists .
and for the last decade or so , it &apos;s been quite clear what being an atheist means .
there have been some very vocal atheists who &apos;ve pointed out , not just that religion is wrong , but that it &apos;s ridiculous .
these people , many of whom have lived in north oxford , have argued -- they &apos;ve argued that believing in god is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game .
i think it &apos;s too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way .
and what i &apos;d like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like , a new version of atheism we could call atheism 2.0 .
now what is atheism 2.0 ?
well it starts from a very basic premise : of course , there &apos;s no god .
of course , there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels , etc .
now let &apos;s move on ; that &apos;s not the end of the story , that &apos;s the very , very beginning .
i &apos;m interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , &quot; i can &apos;t believe in any of this stuff .
i can &apos;t believe in the doctrines .
i don &apos;t think these doctrines are right .
but , &quot; a very important but , &quot; i love christmas carols .
i really like looking at old churches .
i really like turning the pages of the old testament . &quot;
whatever it may be , you know the kind of thing i &apos;m talking about -- people who are attracted to the ritualistic side , the moralistic , communal side of religion , but can &apos;t bear the doctrine .
until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
it &apos;s almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you &apos;re living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart .
so that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
i think there is an alternative .
i think there are ways -- and i &apos;m being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions .
if you don &apos;t believe in a religion , there &apos;s nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
and for me , atheism 2.0 is about both , as i say , a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying , &quot; what here could we use ? &quot;
the secular world is full of holes .
and a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well .
and i &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
when we think about how we &apos;re going to make the world a better place , we think education ; that &apos;s where we put a lot of money .
education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it &apos;s also going to make us better people .
you know the kind of thing a commencement address is , and graduation ceremonies , those lyrical claims that education , the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .
that &apos;s a lovely idea .
in the early 19th century , church attendance in western europe started sliding down very , very sharply , and people panicked .
they asked themselves the following question .
they said , where are people going to find the morality , where are they going to find guidance , and where are they going to find sources of consolation ?
and influential voices came up with one answer .
it &apos;s to culture that we should look for guidance , for consolation , for morality .
let &apos;s look to the plays of shakespeare , the dialogues of plato , the novels of jane austen .
now i think that &apos;s a very beautiful idea and a very true idea .
they wanted to replace scripture with culture .
and that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
if you went to a top university -- let &apos;s say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge -- and you said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here because i &apos;m in search of morality , guidance and consolation ; i want to know how to live , &quot; they would show you the way to the insane asylum .
this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .
why ? they don &apos;t think we need it .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
what we need is information .
now religions start from a very different place indeed .
all religions , all major religions , at various points call us children .
and like children , they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .
we &apos;re only just holding it together .
perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
but anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
and we need help . of course , we need help .
and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .
you know , in the 18th century in the u.k. , the greatest preacher , greatest religious preacher , was a man called john wesley , who went up and down this country delivering sermons , advising people how they could live .
he delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents , the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich .
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of sermons .
if you said to a modern liberal individualist , &quot; hey , how about a sermon ? &quot;
they &apos;d go , &quot; no , no . i don &apos;t need one of those .
i &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
what &apos;s the difference between a sermon and our modern , secular mode of delivery , the lecture ?
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , morality and consolation -- and religions know that .
another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once , they &apos;ll remember it .
sit them in a classroom , tell them about plato at the age of 20 , send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years , and that lesson will stick with them .
religions go , &quot; nonsense .
so get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
that &apos;s what all religions tell us : &quot; get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
otherwise our minds are like sieves .
so religions are cultures of repetition .
they circle the great truths again and again and again .
we associate repetition with boredom .
&quot; give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
&quot; the new is better than the old . &quot;
if i said to you , &quot; okay , we &apos;re not going to have new ted .
we &apos;re just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they &apos;re so true .
we &apos;re going to watch elizabeth gilbert five times because what she says is so clever , &quot; you &apos;d feel cheated .
not so if you &apos;re adopting a religious mindset .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
all the major religions give us calendars .
what is a calendar ?
a calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas .
in the catholic chronology , catholic calendar , at the end of march you will think about st. jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
in the secular world we think , &quot; if an idea is important , i &apos;ll bump into it .
i &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
nonsense , says the religious world view .
religious view says we need calendars , we need to structure time , we need to synchronize encounters .
take the moon . it &apos;s really important to look at the moon .
you know , when you look at the moon , you think , &quot; i &apos;m really small . what are my problems ? &quot;
it sets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
we should all look at the moon a bit more often . we don &apos;t .
why don &apos;t we ? well there &apos;s nothing to tell us , &quot; look at the moon . &quot;
but if you &apos;re a zen buddhist in the middle of september , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi , where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of .
you &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a secure place in your heart .
that &apos;s very good .
the other thing that religions are really aware of is : speak well -- i &apos;m not doing a very good job of this here -- but oratory , oratory is absolutely key to religions .
in the secular world , you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .
but the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
what you &apos;re saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .
so if you go to an african american pentecostalist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
after every convincing point , people will go , &quot; amen , amen , amen . &quot;
at the end of a really rousing paragraph , they &apos;ll all stand up , and they &apos;ll go , &quot; thank you jesus , thank you christ , thank you savior . &quot;
if we were doing it like they do it -- let &apos;s not do it , but if we were to do it -- i would tell you something like , &quot; culture should replace scripture . &quot;
and you would go , &quot; amen , amen , amen . &quot;
and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; thank you plato , thank you shakespeare , thank you jane austen . &quot;
and we &apos;d know that we had a real rhythm going .
all right , all right . we &apos;re getting there . we &apos;re getting there .
the other thing that religions know is we &apos;re not just brains , we are also bodies .
so for example , take the jewish idea of forgiveness .
jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh .
they don &apos;t just deliver us sermons on this .
they don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
they tell us to have a bath .
so in orthodox jewish communities , every friday you go to a mikveh .
you immerse yourself in the water , and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea .
we don &apos;t tend to do that .
our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
let &apos;s look at art now .
now art is something that in the secular world , we think very highly of . we think art is really , really important .
a lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums , etc .
we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals , or our new churches .
you &apos;ve heard that saying .
now i think that the potential is there , but we &apos;ve completely let ourselves down .
and the reason we &apos;ve let ourselves down is that we &apos;re not properly studying how religions handle art .
the two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art : the first idea is that art should be for art &apos;s sake -- a ridiculous idea -- an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world .
i couldn &apos;t disagree more .
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
that &apos;s why a very common feeling when you &apos;re in a museum -- let &apos;s admit it -- is , &quot; i don &apos;t know what this is about . &quot;
but if we &apos;re serious people , we don &apos;t admit to that .
now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
art is about two things in all the major faiths .
firstly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to love .
and secondly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
and that &apos;s what art is .
art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
so as you walk around a church , or a mosque or a cathedral , what you &apos;re trying to imbibe , what you &apos;re imbibing is , through your eyes , through your senses , truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
rembrandt is a propagandist in the christian view .
now the word &quot; propaganda &quot; sets off alarm bells .
we think of hitler , we think of stalin . don &apos;t , necessarily .
propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something .
and if that thing is good , there &apos;s no problem with it at all .
my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum -- if i was a museum curator , i would make a room for love , a room for generosity .
all works of art are talking to us about things .
and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we &apos;ve neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
art should be didactic .
let &apos;s think of something else .
they &apos;re poets , they &apos;re philosophers , they &apos;re photographers , they &apos;re filmmakers .
and they tend to be on their own .
they &apos;re our cottage industries . they are vulnerable , single people .
and they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
and they don &apos;t really change much .
now think about religions , think about organized religions .
what do organized religions do ?
they group together , they form institutions .
and that has all sorts of advantages .
first of all , scale , might .
the catholic church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the wall street journal .
these are massive machines .
they &apos;re collaborative , they &apos;re branded , they &apos;re multinational , and they &apos;re highly disciplined .
these are all very good qualities .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
and corporations are very like religions in many ways , except they &apos;re right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs .
they &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
books alone , books written by lone individuals , are not going to change anything .
we need to group together .
and that &apos;s what religions do .
they are multinational , as i say , they are branded , they have a clear identity , so they don &apos;t get lost in a busy world .
that &apos;s something we can learn from .
i want to conclude .
really what i want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields , there is something to learn from the example of religion -- even if you don &apos;t believe any of it .
if you &apos;re involved in anything that &apos;s communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
if you &apos;re involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
look very closely at pilgrimage .
we haven &apos;t begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven &apos;t looked at what religions do with travel .
if you &apos;re in the art world , look at the example of what religions are doing with art .
and if you &apos;re an educator in any way , again , look at how religions are spreading ideas .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they &apos;re highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
so really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion , but at the end of the day , religions are so subtle , so complicated , so intelligent in many ways that they &apos;re not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone ; they &apos;re for all of us .
thank you very much .
now this is actually a courageous talk , because you &apos;re kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .
you can get shot by both sides .
you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment .
indeed .
but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense -- that &apos;s actually probably the most important thing to anyone who &apos;s religious -- of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that &apos;s bigger than you are .
is there any room for that experience in atheism 2.0 ?
absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; but isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
and i go , &quot; no . &quot; why does that sense of mystery , that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe , need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling ?
science and just observation gives us that feeling without it , so i don &apos;t feel the need .
the universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious superstructure .
so one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit .
actually , let me just ask a question .
how many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
is there an equivalent process by which there &apos;s a sort of bridge between what you &apos;re talking about and what you would say to them ?
i would say that there are many , many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .
it &apos;s not as though , as i try to suggest , it &apos;s not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you don &apos;t have religion and then you &apos;re cut off from all these very good things .
it &apos;s so sad that we constantly say , &quot; i don &apos;t believe so i can &apos;t have community , so i &apos;m cut off from morality , so i can &apos;t go on a pilgrimage . &quot;
one wants to say , &quot; nonsense . why not ? &quot;
and that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
there &apos;s so much we can absorb .
atheism shouldn &apos;t cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
it seems to me that there &apos;s plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists .
but probably most people in the community certainly don &apos;t think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war , that there could be bridging ?
no , we need to be polite about differences .
politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
it &apos;s seen as hypocrisy .
but we need to get to a stage when you &apos;re an atheist and someone says , &quot; well you know , i did pray the other day , &quot; you politely ignore it .
you move on .
and i think that &apos;s what the religious wars of late have ignored .
they &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
and finally , does this new thing that you &apos;re proposing that &apos;s not a religion but something else , does it need a leader , and are you volunteering to be the pope ?
well , one thing that we &apos;re all very suspicious of is individual leaders .
it doesn &apos;t need it .
what i &apos;ve tried to lay out is a framework and i &apos;m hoping that people can just fill it in .
i &apos;ve sketched a sort of broad framework .
but wherever you are , as i say , if you &apos;re in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
if you &apos;re in the communal industry , look at religion and do the communal bit .
so it &apos;s a wiki project .
alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .
alain de botton : atheism 2.0
what aspects of religion should atheists adopt ? alain de botton suggests a &quot; religion for atheists &quot; -- call it atheism 2.0 -- that incorporates religious forms and traditions to satisfy our human need for connection , ritual and transcendence .
i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon , which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it .
my own interest in this subject , and my passion for it , began rather accidentally .
i had bought a copy of this book , &quot; the universe and dr. einstein &quot; -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle .
a few years after that , in bangalore , i was finding it hard to fall asleep one night , and i picked up this book , thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes .
and as it happened , i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .
and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do .
and that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
that feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that i could partake in the joy of science , and also the joy of communicating it to others .
and that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts , to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes , detectors , instruments that people are building , or have built , in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail .
and today i would like to share with you some images , some stories of these trips .
i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe .
and i first begin with a pie chart -- and i promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation -- but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we &apos;re all made of -- and that &apos;s four percent of the universe .
astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe , which makes up 23 percent of the universe , and something called dark energy , which permeates the fabric of space-time , that makes up another 73 percent .
so if you look at this pie chart , 96 percent of the universe , at this point in our exploration of it , is unknown or not well understood .
and most of the experiments , telescopes that i went to see are in some way addressing this question , these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy .
i will take you first to an underground mine in northern minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter .
and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors .
and the reason why they have to go underground is that , if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth , the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays , ambient radio activity , even our own bodies . you might not believe it , but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment .
so they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector .
and i went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can barely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s entirely dark in there -- this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in 1960 .
and physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s .
and the miners in the early part of the last century worked , literally , in candlelight .
and today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
this is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
and , among other things , they &apos;re looking for dark matter .
there is another way to search for dark matter , which is indirectly .
if dark matter exists in our universe , in our galaxy , then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos .
and neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules .
when a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light , a flash of blue light , and by looking for this blue light , you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then , indirectly , something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .
but you need very , very large volumes of water in order to do this .
and where in the world would you find such water ?
well the russians have a tank in their own backyard .
this is lake baikal .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
it &apos;s about 40 to 50 km wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep .
and what the russians are doing is they &apos;re building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light .
and this is the scene that greeted me when i landed there .
this is lake baikal in the peak of the siberian winter .
the lake is entirely frozen .
and the line of black dots that you see in the background , that &apos;s the ice camp where the physicists are working .
the reason why they have to work in winter is because they don &apos;t have the money to work in summer and spring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and submersibles to do their work .
so they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work .
so this is the russians working on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter .
they have to drill holes in the ice , dive down into the water -- cold , cold water -- to get hold of the instrument , bring it up , do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice melts .
because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it &apos;s full of cracks .
and you have to imagine , there &apos;s an entire sea-like lake underneath , moving .
i still don &apos;t understand this one russian man working in his bare chest , but that tells you how hard he was working .
and these people , a handful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist .
and they have dedicated their lives to it .
and just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
it &apos;s very harsh conditions .
they work on a shoestring budget .
and it &apos;s that basic , but they do this every year .
from siberia to the atacama desert in chile , to see something called the very large telescope .
the very large telescope is one of these things that astronomers do -- they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively .
i can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re planning is called the extremely large telescope .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .
but nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
and these telescopes , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
and the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror .
each mirror , there are four of them , is made of a single piece of glass , a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic , that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is &#91; to &#93; imagine a city like paris , with all its buildings and the eiffel tower , if you grind down paris to that kind of accuracy , you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high .
and that &apos;s the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured .
an extraordinary set of telescopes .
here &apos;s another view of the same .
the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert .
the dry air is really good for telescopes , and also , the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies .
finally , i want to take you to antarctica .
i want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .
this is cosmology &apos;s final frontier .
some of the most amazing experiments , some of the most extreme experiments , are being done in antarctica .
i was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight , which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere , the upper stratosphere , 40 km up .
and that &apos;s where they do their experiments , and then the balloon , the payload , is brought down .
that &apos;s an american c-17 cargo plane that flew us from new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica .
and here we are about to board our bus .
and i don &apos;t know if you can read the lettering , but it says , &quot; ivan the terribus . &quot;
and that &apos;s taking us to mcmurdo .
and this is the scene that greets you in mcmurdo .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
because it &apos;s so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there .
it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
this is mcmurdo itself . about a thousand people work here in summer , and about 200 in winter when it &apos;s completely dark for six months .
this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km .
what i want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight .
so you &apos;re using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km .
and the engineers , the technicians , the physicists have all got to assemble on the ross ice shelf , because antarctica -- i won &apos;t go into the reasons why -- but it &apos;s one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches , except for the weather .
the weather , as you can imagine , this is summer , and you &apos;re standing on 200 ft of ice .
and there &apos;s a volcano behind , which has glaciers at the very top .
and what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon -- the fabric , parachute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with helium .
and that process takes about two hours .
and the weather can change as they &apos;re putting together this whole assembly .
for instance , here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind , which is eventually going to be filled up with helium .
those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium .
now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to mcmurdo station .
and this particular balloon , because it has to launch two tons of weight , is an extremely huge balloon .
in order to minimize the weight , it &apos;s very thin , it &apos;s as thin as a sandwich wrapper .
and if they have to pack it back , they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except , when they did it first , it would have been done in texas .
here , they can &apos;t do it with the kind shoes they &apos;re wearing , so they have to take their shoes off , get barefoot into the boxes , in this cold , and do that kind of work .
that &apos;s the kind of dedication these people have .
here &apos;s the balloon being filled up with helium , and you can see it &apos;s a gorgeous sight .
here &apos;s a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end .
so the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side , and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there &apos;s a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute , and then the parachute is then connected to the payload .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
they &apos;re wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff , but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .
and i would like to share with you a launch .
radio : okay , release the balloon , release the balloon , release the balloon .
anil ananthaswamy : and i &apos;ll finally like to leave you with two images .
this is an observatory in the himalayas , in ladakh in india .
and the thing i want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side .
and on the far left there is a 400 year-old buddhist monastery .
this is a close-up of the buddhist monastery .
and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has .
one is exploring the cosmos on the outside , and the other one is exploring our interior being .
and both require silence of some sort .
and what struck me was every place that i went to to see these telescopes , the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence , whether it &apos;s silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever .
and it was very obvious that , if we destroy these silent places on earth , we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards , because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space .
thank you .
all over the planet , giant telescopes and detectors are looking for clues to the workings of the universe . at the ink conference , science writer anil ananthaswamy tours us around these amazing installations , taking us to some of the most remote and silent places on earth .
we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children .
if we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to get the generation we deserve .
they &apos;re going to learn from whatever it is they have around them .
and we , as now the elite , parents , librarians , professionals , whatever it is , a bunch of our activities are , in fact , in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us , or as broadly as we can .
i &apos;m going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone .
one is what &apos;s on the boston public library .
carved above their door is , &quot; free to all . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
i &apos;m a librarian , and what i &apos;m trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it .
and the idea of using technology is perfect for us .
i think we have the opportunity to one-up the greeks .
it &apos;s not easy to one-up the greeks . but with the industriousness of the egyptians , they were able to build the library of alexandria -- the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world .
the problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it .
on the other hand , if you did , then great things happened .
i think we can one-up the greeks and achieve something .
and i &apos;m going to try to argue only one point today : that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp .
so if i &apos;m successful , then you &apos;ll actually come away thinking , yeah , we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published , everything that was ever meant for distribution , available to anybody in the world that &apos;s ever wanted to have access to it .
yes , there &apos;s issues about how money should be distributed , and that &apos;s still being refigured out .
but i &apos;d say there &apos;s plenty of money , and there &apos;s plenty of demand , so we can actually achieve that .
but i &apos;m going to go over the technological , social and sort of where are we as a whole , trying to get to that particular vision .
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
well , we don &apos;t really know , but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress . it &apos;s 26 million volumes , 26 million volumes .
so a megabyte , 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes -- it goes mega- , giga- , tera- . 26 terabytes .
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that &apos;s about this big , on spinning linux drives , and it costs about 60,000 dollars .
so for the cost of a house -- or around here , a garage -- you can put , you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress .
that &apos;s pretty neat .
then the question is , what do you get ?
you know , is it worth trying to get there ?
do you actually want it online ?
some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
and you can download these things , and look around them in new and different ways .
and you can get at them remotely , if you happen to have a laptop .
there &apos;s starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways , and you can search them , make little tabs , and it &apos;s kind of cute -- still very book-like -- on your laptop .
but i don &apos;t know , reading things on a laptop -- whenever i pull up my laptop , it always feels like work .
i think that &apos;s one of the reasons why the kindle is so great .
i don &apos;t have to feel like i &apos;m at work to read a kindle .
but i have to say that there &apos;s older technologies that i tend to like .
i like the physical book .
and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things , put them on the net , and then download , print them and bind them , and end up with books again .
and we sort of said , well , how hard is this ?
and it turns out to not be very hard .
we actually went off to make a bookmobile .
it costs about three dollars to download , print and bind a normal , old book .
and they actually come out kind of nice looking .
you can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page , sort of the parts cost for doing this .
so the idea of -- this technology actually may end up putting books back in people &apos;s hands again .
there are some other bookmobiles running around .
this is eric eldred making books at walden pond -- thoreau &apos;s works .
this is just before he got kicked out by the parks services , for competing with the bookstore there .
in india , they &apos;ve got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria , the new library of alexandria , in egypt .
it was quite popularly attended .
and kids starting to make their own books , and a happy kid with the first book that he &apos;s ever owned .
so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro , but i think it still has its place .
and being from the silicon valley , sort of utopian sort of world , we thought , if we can make this technology work in rural uganda , we might have something .
so we actually got some funding from the world bank to try it out .
and we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from silicon valley , fly them to uganda , buy a car , set up the first internet connection at the national library of uganda , figure out what they wanted , and get a program going making books in rural uganda .
and it actually -- so technologically , it works .
what we found out of this is we didn &apos;t have the right books .
so the books were in the library . we could get it to people , if they &apos;re digitized , but we didn &apos;t know how to quite get them digitized .
everybody thought the answer is , send things to india and china .
and so we &apos;ve tried that , and i &apos;ll go over that in a moment .
there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well .
one is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine .
it &apos;s all conveyor belt , and it makes a book .
and it &apos;s called the &quot; espresso book machine , &quot; and in about 10 minutes , you can press a button and make a book .
something else i &apos;m quite excited about in this particular domain , beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand , is some of these new little screens that are coming out .
and one of my favorites in this is the $ 100 laptop .
and i don &apos;t mean to steal any thunder here , but we &apos;ve gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader .
so here &apos;s one of the beta units and you can -- it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader .
and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it , and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good .
we &apos;re in good enough shape .
you actually can go and read scanned books quite easily .
so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
so we thought , okay , well , let &apos;s try out this send books to india thing .
and there was a project with , funded by the national science foundation -- sent a bunch of scanners , and the american libraries were supposed to send books .
well , they didn &apos;t . they didn &apos;t want to send their books .
so we bought 100,000 books and sent them to india .
and then we learned why you don &apos;t want to send books to india .
the lesson we learned out of this is , scan your own books .
if you really care about books , you &apos;re going to scan them better , especially if they &apos;re valuable books .
if they &apos;re new books and you can just , you know , butcher them , because you could just buy another one , that &apos;s not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning .
but do things that you love .
but the indians have been scanning a lot of their own books -- about 300,000 now -- doing very well .
the chinese did over a million , and the egyptians are about 30,000 .
how do we go and do this , and how do we get it down so that it &apos;s a cost point that we could afford ?
and we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page .
if it &apos;s basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize , ocr , package it up , make it so that you could download , print and bind it -- the whole shebang -- we would have achieved something .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
and we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well -- sort of these auto-page-turning things .
if we can have mars rovers , you &apos;d think you could turn pages .
but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages , and the volume isn &apos;t there .
so anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner , and with two digital , high-grade , professional digital cameras , controlled museum lighting , so even if it &apos;s a black and white book , you can go and get the proper intonation .
so you basically do a beautiful , respectful job .
this is not a fax , this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job as you &apos;re going through these libraries .
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
this is what it looks like at the university of toronto .
and actually , it turns out to , you know , pay a living wage .
people seem to love it .
yes , it &apos;s a little boring , but some people kind of get into the zen of it .
and especially if it &apos;s kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .
we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this , at getting 10 cents a page .
so 10 cents a page , 300 pages in your average book , 30 dollars a book .
the library of congress , if you did the whole darn thing -- 26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars , right ?
but a million books , i think , actually would be a pretty good start , and that would cost 30 million dollars . that &apos;s not that big a bill .
and what we &apos;ve been able to do is get into libraries .
we &apos;ve now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries , and libraries are up for having their books scanned .
so we &apos;re starting to get the institutional responsibility .
the thing we &apos;re missing is the 10 cents .
if we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
we &apos;ve scanned about 200,000 books .
now we &apos;re scanning about 15,000 books a month , and it &apos;s starting to gear up another factor of two from there .
so all in all , that &apos;s going very well .
and we &apos;re starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world .
so i think of -- we &apos;re kind of going from the out-of-copyright , library stuff , and amazon.com is coming from the in-print world .
and i think we &apos;ll meet in the middle some place , and have the classic thing that you have , which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel .
and so we &apos;re starting up a program to do out-of-print works , but loaning them .
exactly what loaning means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
but anyway , loaning out-of-print works from the boston public library , the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over .
so all in all , it &apos;s possible to do this in large scale .
we &apos;re also going back over microfilm and getting that online .
so , we can do 10 cents a page , we &apos;re going 15,000 books a month and we &apos;ve got about 250,000 books online , counting all the other projects that are starting to add in .
so what i wanted to argue is , books are within our grasp .
the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal .
yes , it costs tens of millions , low hundreds of millions , but one time shot and we &apos;ve got basically the history of printed literature online .
and then , there &apos;s business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .
but it is within our grasp , technologically and law-wise , at least for the out of print and out of copyright , we suggest , to be able to get the whole darn thing online .
now let &apos;s go for audio , and i &apos;m going to go through these .
so how much is there ?
but we &apos;ve found that the rights issues are really quite thorny .
this is a fairly heavily litigated area , so we &apos;ve found that there are niches in the music world that aren &apos;t served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system .
and we &apos;ve been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net .
in the united states , it doesn &apos;t cost you to give something away . right ?
if you give something to a charity or to the public , you get a pat on the back and a tax donation -- except on the net , where you can go broke .
if you put up a video of your garage band , and it starts getting heavily accessed , you can lose your guitars or your house .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so we &apos;ve offered unlimited storage , unlimited bandwidth , forever , for free , to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library .
and we &apos;ve been getting a lot of takers . one is the rock &apos; n &apos; rollers .
the rock &apos; n &apos; rollers had a tradition of sharing , as long as nobody made any money . you could -- concert recordings , it &apos;s not the commercial recordings , but concert recordings , started by the grateful dead .
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
they give permission , and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day .
we have about 40,000 concerts , everything the grateful dead ever did , up on the net , so that people can see it and listen to this material .
so audio is possible to put up , but the rights issues are really pretty thorny .
we &apos;ve got a lot of collections now -- a couple hundred thousand items -- and it &apos;s growing over time .
moving images : if you think of theatrical releases , there are not that many of them .
as best we can tell , there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution . it &apos;s just not that many .
but half of those were indian .
so we &apos;ve digitized those and made those available .
but we &apos;ve found that there &apos;s lots of other types of movies that haven &apos;t really seen the light of day -- archival films .
so we &apos;ve been starting to make these available and it &apos;s grown to be very popular .
we &apos;re not quite a youtube .
television comes quite a bit larger .
we started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day .
it &apos;s sort of the biggest tivo box you &apos;ve ever seen .
it &apos;s about a petabyte , so far , of worldwide television -- russian , chinese , japanese , iraqi , al jazeera , bbc , cnn , abc , cbs , nbc -- 24 hours a day .
we only put one week up , which is mostly for cost reasons , which is the 9 / 11 , sort of from 9 / 11 / 2001 . for one week , what did the world see ?
cnn was saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets .
were they ? let &apos;s look at the palestinian television and find out .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
and television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable , except by jon stewart , who does a fabulous job .
so anyway , television is , i would suggest , within our grasp .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net .
so we &apos;ve got about 100,000 pieces up there .
so books , music , video , software . there &apos;s only 50,000 titles of it .
mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections .
but we &apos;ve worked through some of those , but we &apos;ve still got real problems in washington .
well , we &apos;re best known as the world wide web .
we &apos;ve been archiving the world wide web since 1996 .
we take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it , every two months .
and actually , it &apos;s really been pioneered by alexa internet , which donates this collection to the internet archive .
and it &apos;s been growing along for the last 11 years , and it &apos;s a fantastic resource .
and we &apos;ve made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
if you go and search on something -- this is google.com , the different versions of it that we have , this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release , and this is what it looked like at stanford .
mostly , people want to see their old stuff out of this .
if there &apos;s one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one , which is probably best known for burning , is , don &apos;t just have one copy .
so we &apos;ve started to -- we &apos;ve made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the library of alexandria .
so this is a picture of the internet archive at the library of alexandria .
and we now have also another copy building up in amsterdam .
so , we should put it in the san andreas fault line in san francisco , flood zone in amsterdam and in the middle east . right , so anyway ...
so we &apos;re hedging our bets here .
if we go and put it in a couple more places , i think we &apos;ll be in good shape .
there &apos;s a political and social question out of this .
there &apos;s some large companies that have seen this vision , that are doing large-scale digitization , but they &apos;re locking up the public domain .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
what &apos;s the role of the public versus the private as things go forward ?
how do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future , just as we basically benefited as we were growing up ?
so universal access to all knowledge -- i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind , like the man on the moon , or the gutenberg bible , or the library of alexandria .
it could be something that we &apos;re remembered for , for millennia , for having achieved .
and as i said before , i &apos;ll end with something that &apos;s carved above the door of the carnegie library .
carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country -- carved above his legacy , &quot; free to the people . &quot;
brewster kahle : a free digital library
brewster kahle is building a truly huge digital library -- every book ever published , every movie ever released , all the strata of web history ... it &apos;s all free to the public -- unless someone else gets to it first .
imagine , if you will -- a gift .
i &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
it &apos;s not too big -- about the size of a golf ball .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you .
it will bring all of your family together .
you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
it will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .
you &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
you &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
you &apos;ll expand your vocabulary , meet new people , and you &apos;ll have a healthier lifestyle .
and get this -- you &apos;ll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
you &apos;ll eat countless gourmet meals .
flowers will arrive by the truckload .
people will say to you , &quot; you look great . have you had any work done ? &quot;
and you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
you &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled .
your life will have new meaning .
peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
$ 55,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal .
by now i know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
does amazon carry it ?
is there a waiting list ?
not likely .
this gift came to me about five months ago .
and this , and then this .
it was a rare gem -- a brain tumor , hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving .
and while i &apos;m okay now , i wouldn &apos;t wish this gift for you .
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
but i wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
it profoundly altered my life in ways i didn &apos;t expect in all the ways i just shared with you .
so the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift .
stacey kramer : the best gift i ever survived
stacey kramer offers a moving , personal , 3-minute parable that shows how an unwanted experience -- frightening , traumatic , costly -- can turn out to be a priceless gift .
i love a challenge , and saving the earth is probably a good one .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
we have now entered in the 6x , the sixth major extinction on this planet .
i often wondered , if there was a united organization of organisms -- otherwise known as &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- -- and every organism had a right to vote , would we be voted on the planet , or off the planet ?
i think that vote is occurring right now .
i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions , using fungi , and these solutions are based on mycelium .
the mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it &apos;s extremely tenacious .
they &apos;re the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians .
they generate the humus soils across the landmasses of earth .
we have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants , mitigated by the mcyelium -- so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks , cedars and douglas firs .
dusty and i , we like to say , on sunday , this is where we go to church .
i &apos;m in love with the old-growth forest , and i &apos;m a patriotic american because we have those .
most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms .
when i mention mushrooms to somebody , they immediately think portobellos or magic mushrooms , their eyes glaze over , and they think i &apos;m a little crazy .
so , i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group .
we call it mycophobia , the irrational fear of the unknown , when it comes to fungi .
day 21 , day 23 , day 25 .
mushrooms produce strong antibiotics .
in fact , we &apos;re more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom .
a group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta -- a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together .
we share in common the same pathogens .
fungi don &apos;t like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .
but here is a mushroom that &apos;s past its prime .
after they sporulate , they do rot .
but i propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest .
they give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
and so we see a mushroom here sporulating .
and the spores are germinating , and the mycelium forms and goes underground .
in a single cubic inch of soil , there can be more than eight miles of these cells .
my foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium .
this is photomicrographs from nick read and patrick hickey .
and notice that as the mycelium grows , it conquers territory and then it begins the net .
i &apos;ve been a scanning electron microscopist for many years , i have thousands of electron micrographs , and when i &apos;m staring at the mycelium , i realize that they are microfiltration membranes .
we exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
it inhales oxygen , just like we do .
and i present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes .
and in these cavities , these micro-cavities form , and as they fuse soils , they absorb water .
these are little wells .
and inside these wells , then microbial communities begin to form .
and so the spongy soil not only resists erosion , but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms .
i first proposed , in the early 1990s , that mycelium is earth &apos;s natural internet .
when you look at the mycelium , they &apos;re highly branched .
and if there &apos;s one branch that is broken , then very quickly , because of the nodes of crossing -- internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information .
the mycelium is sentient .
it knows that you are there .
when you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
so , i believe the invention of the computer internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven , biologically successful model .
the earth invented the computer internet for its own benefit , and we now , being the top organism on this planet , are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere .
going way out , dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype .
i believe matter begets life ; life becomes single cells ; single cells become strings ; strings become chains ; chains network .
and this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .
most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land .
they came to land 1.3 billion years ago , and plants followed several hundred million years later .
how is that possible ?
it &apos;s possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids , and many other acids and enzymes , pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates .
makes the rocks crumble , and the first step in the generation of soil .
oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together .
and all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix .
this was first discovered in 1859 .
this is a photograph by franz hueber .
this photograph &apos;s taken 1950s in saudi arabia .
420 million years ago , this organism existed .
it was called prototaxites .
prototaxites , laying down , was about three feet tall .
the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet .
dr. boyce , at the university of chicago , published an article in the journal of geology this past year determining that prototaxites was a giant fungus , a giant mushroom .
across the landscapes of earth were dotted these giant mushrooms .
all across most land masses .
and these existed for tens of millions of years .
now , we &apos;ve had several extinction events , and as we march forward -- 65 million years ago -- most of you know about it -- we had an asteroid impact .
the earth was struck by an asteroid , a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .
sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the earth .
those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded , because fungi do not need light .
more recently , at einstein university , they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy , much like plants use light .
so , the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere , i think , is a forgone conclusion , at least in my own mind .
the largest organism in the world is in eastern oregon .
i couldn &apos;t miss it . it was 2,200 acres in size : 2,200 acres in size , 2,000 years old .
the largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat , one cell wall thick .
how is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ?
we were involved with several experiments .
i &apos;m going to show you six , if i can , solutions for helping to save the world .
battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham , washington .
there were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste : one was a control pile ; one pile was treated with enzymes ; one pile was treated with bacteria ; and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .
the mycelium absorbs the oil .
the mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .
these are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together .
so , the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil , and then , when we returned six weeks later , all the tarps were removed , all the other piles were dead , dark and stinky .
we came back to our pile , it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms , and the color changed to a light form .
the enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
they &apos;re very large .
they &apos;re showing how much nutrition that they could &apos;ve obtained .
but something else happened , which was an epiphany in my life .
they sporulated , the spores attract insects , the insects laid eggs , eggs became larvae .
birds then came , bringing in seeds , and our pile became an oasis of life .
whereas the other three piles were dead , dark and stinky , and the pah &apos;s -- the aromatic hydrocarbons -- went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks .
the last image we don &apos;t have .
the entire pile was a green berm of life .
these are gateway species , vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities .
so i invented burlap sacks , bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris , you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that &apos;s producing e. coli , or other wastes , or a factory with chemical toxins , and it leads to habitat restoration .
so , we set up a site in mason county , washington , and we &apos;ve seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms .
this is a logarithmic scale , 10 to the eighth power .
there &apos;s more than a 100 million colonies per gram , and 10 to the third power is around 1,000 .
in 48 hours to 72 hours , these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times .
think of the implications .
this is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .
so , this one mushroom , in particular , has drawn our interest over time .
this is my wife dusty , with a mushroom called fomitopsis officinalis -- agarikon .
it &apos;s a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest that dioscorides first described in 65 a.d.
as a treatment against consumption .
this mushroom grows in washington state , oregon , northern california , british columbia , now thought to be extinct in europe .
may not seem that large -- let &apos;s get closer .
this is extremely rare fungus .
our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out -- we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year .
we found one sample to be able to get into culture .
preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health .
i &apos;ve been involved with the u.s. defense department bioshield program .
we submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water , and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites .
and a few years ago , we received these results .
we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses .
dr. earl kern , who &apos;s a smallpox expert of the u.s. defense department , states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
our mushroom strains were in the highly active range .
or you can go to npr.org and listen to a live interview .
so , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses .
here &apos;s the selectivity index numbers -- against pox , you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses , compared to the ribavirin controls , we have an extraordinarily high activity .
and we &apos;re using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .
we tried it against flu a viruses -- h1n1 , h3n2 -- as well as flu b viruses .
so then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against h5n1 , and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index .
i then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense .
i became interested in entomopathogenic fungi -- fungi that kill insects .
our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants .
so , i went to the epa homepage , and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants , as well as termites .
i did something that nobody else had done .
i actually chased the mycelium , when it stopped producing spores .
these are spores -- this is in their spores .
i was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .
and so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house .
but the insects aren &apos;t stupid , and they would avoid the spores when they came close , and so i morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form .
and i got my daughter &apos;s barbie doll dish , i put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields , every day , in my house , and the ants were attracted to the mycelium , because there &apos;s no spores .
they gave it to the queen .
one week later , i had no sawdust piles whatsoever .
and then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death -- the mycelium is consumed by the ants , they become mummified , and , boing , a mushroom pops out of their head .
now after sporulation , the spores repel .
so , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites .
and so my house came down , i received my first patent against carpenter ants , termites and fire ants .
then we tried extracts , and lo and behold , we can steer insects to different directions .
this has huge implications .
i then received my second patent -- and this is a big one .
it &apos;s been called an alexander graham bell patent .
it covers over 200,000 species .
this is the most disruptive technology -- i &apos;ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry -- that they have ever witnessed .
this could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world .
you could fly 100 ph.d. students under the umbrella of this concept , because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi , prior to sporulation , attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores .
and so i came up with a life box , because i needed a delivery system .
the life box -- you &apos;re gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
and then you put tree seeds in here , and then you end up growing -- potentially -- an old-growth forest from a cardboard box .
i want to reinvent the delivery system , and the use of cardboard around the world , so they become ecological footprints .
if there &apos;s a youtube-like site that you could put up , you could make it interactive , zip code specific -- where people could join together , and through satellite imaging systems , through virtual earth or google earth , you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through life boxes .
you could take a cardboard box delivering shoes , you could add water -- i developed this for the refugee community -- corns , beans and squash and onions .
i took several containers -- my wife said , if i could do this , anybody could -- and i ended up growing a seed garden .
then you harvest the seeds -- and thank you , eric rasmussen , for your help on this -- and then you &apos;re harvesting the seed garden .
then you can harvest the kernels , and then you just need a few kernels .
i add mycelium to it , and then i inoculate the corncobs .
now , three corncobs , no other grain -- lots of mushrooms begin to form .
but watch what happens here .
the mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars .
and so i thought , how could we address the energy crisis in this country ?
and we came up with econol .
generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary -- and you gain all the benefits that i &apos;ve described to you already .
but to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent , and i think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels .
so , we build the carbon banks on the planet , renew the soils .
these are a species that we need to join with .
i think engaging mycelium can help save the world .
paul stamets : 6 ways mushrooms can save the world
i have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres .
of course we all here in this room live in biosphere 1 .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres .
and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
so what did i learn ? well , here i am inside biosphere 2 , making a pizza .
so i am harvesting the wheat , in order to make the dough .
and then of course i have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese .
it took me four months in biosphere 2 to make a pizza .
here in biosphere 1 , well it takes me about two minutes , because i pick up the phone and i call and say , &quot; hey , can you deliver the pizza ? &quot;
so biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre , entirely sealed , miniature world that i lived in for two years and 20 minutes .
over the top it was sealed with steel and glass , underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely sealed .
we had a savanna , a marsh , a desert .
we had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything .
and of course we had our human habitat , where we lived .
back in the mid- &apos; 80s when we were designing biosphere 2 , we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions .
i mean , what is a biosphere ?
back then , yes , i guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the earth , right ?
well , you have to get a little more specific than that if you &apos;re going to build one .
and so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is , nothing goes in or out at all , no material -- and energetically open , which is essentially what planet earth is .
this is a chamber that was 1 / 400th the size of biosphere 2 that we called our test module .
and the very first day that this fellow , john allen , walked in , to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we &apos;d put in there to hopefully keep him alive , the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin , or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something , fungus .
but of course none of that happened .
and over the ensuing few years , there were great sagas about designing biosphere 2 .
but by 1991 we finally had this thing built .
and it was time for us to go in and give it a go .
we needed to know , is life this malleable ?
can you take this biosphere , that has evolved on a planetary scale , and jam it into a little bottle , and will it survive ?
big questions .
and we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to mars , for instance , would we take a biosphere with us , to live in it ?
we also wanted to know so we can understand more about the earth that we all live in .
well , in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby .
let &apos;s take it on a maiden voyage .
will it work ? or will something happen that we can &apos;t understand and we can &apos;t fix , thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres ?
more on that later .
and this is the world that we lived in .
so , on the top , we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean , and underneath we had all this technosphere , we called it , which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers , and all of that .
one of the biospherians called it &quot; garden of eden on top of an aircraft carrier . &quot;
this is the agriculture .
it was essentially an organic farm .
the day i walked into biosphere 2 , i was , for the first time , breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world , except seven other people .
at that moment i became part of that biosphere .
and i don &apos;t mean that in an abstract sense ; i mean it rather literally .
when i breathed out , my co2 fed the sweet potatoes that i was growing .
and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes .
and those sweet potatoes became part of me .
in fact , we ate so many sweet potatoes i became orange with sweet potato .
i literally was eating the same carbon over and over again .
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
when it came to our atmosphere , however , it wasn &apos;t that much of a joke over the long term , because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
and we knew that we were losing co2 .
and so we were working to sequester carbon .
good lord -- we know that term now .
we were growing plants like crazy .
we were taking their biomass , storing them in the basement , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .
we were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere .
we stopped tilling , so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air .
but our oxygen was going down faster than our co2 was going up , which was quite unexpected , because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module .
and it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek .
we had lost seven tons of oxygen .
and we had no clue where it was .
and i tell you , when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far ; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness , do you feel dreadful .
i mean we were dragging ourselves around the biosphere .
and we had sleep apnea at night .
so you &apos;d wake up gasping with breath , because your blood chemistry has changed .
and that you literally do that . you stop breathing and then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up . and it &apos;s very irritating .
and everybody outside thought we were dying .
i mean , the media was making it sound like were were dying .
and i had to call up my mother every other day saying , &quot; no , mum , it &apos;s fine , fine .
we &apos;re not dead . we &apos;re fine . we &apos;re fine . &quot;
and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen .
and one day he couldn &apos;t add up a line of figures .
and it was time for us to put oxygen in .
and you might think , well , &quot; boy , your life support system was failing you . wasn &apos;t that dreadful ? &quot;
yes . in a sense it was terrifying .
except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time , if it really got bad , though who was going to say , &quot; i can &apos;t take it anymore ! &quot; ?
not me , that was for sure .
and we did indeed find it .
and we found it in the concrete .
essentially it had done something very simple .
we had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost .
it broke down ; it took oxygen out of the air ; it put co2 into the air ; and it went into the concrete .
pretty straightforward really .
so at the end of the two years when we came out , we were elated , because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite &quot; uhh , &quot; when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that &apos;s a very bad failure .
except that we knew what it was . and we knew how to fix it .
and nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that .
and we proved the concept , more or less .
people , on the other hand , was a different subject .
we were -- yeah i don &apos;t know that we were fixable .
we all went quite nuts , i will say .
and the day i came out of biosphere 2 , i was thrilled i was going to see all my family and my friends .
for two years i &apos;d been seeing people through the glass .
and everybody ran up to me .
and i recoiled . they stank !
people stink !
we stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant , and all kinds of stuff .
now we had stuff inside biosphere to keep ourselves clean , but nothing with perfume .
and boy do we stink out here .
not only that , but i lost touch of where my food came from .
i had no idea what was in my food , where it came from .
i didn &apos;t even recognize half the names in most of the food that i was eating .
in fact , i would stand for hours in the aisles of shops , reading all the names on all of the things .
people must have thought i was nuts .
it was really quite astonishing .
and i slowly lost track of where i was in this big biosphere , in this big biosphere that we all live in .
in biosphere 2 i totally understood that i had a huge impact on my biosphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very viscerally , very literally .
so i went about my business : paragon space development corporation , a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere , because i had nothing else to do .
and one of the things we did was try to figure out : how small can you make these biospheres , and what can you do with them ?
and so we sent one onto the mir space station .
we had one on the shuttle and one on the international space station , for 16 months , where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are .
and i &apos;m also proud to announce that you &apos;re getting a sneak preview -- on friday we &apos;re going to announce that we &apos;re actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon , which is going to be pretty fun .
and the legacy of that is a system that we were designing : an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on mars .
and part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of co2 and oxygen and water through this plant system .
as a result of that modeling i ended up in all places , in eritrea , in the horn of africa .
eritrea , formerly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there .
it is so dry .
this is what i saw .
but this is also what i saw .
in this case it was oilseed .
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals , so that they could produce milk and whatnot , like we had in the biosphere .
they pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean .
they also pollute their next-door neighbors .
so they &apos;re all shitting each other &apos;s ponds , quite literally .
and what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
they were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people .
they had created an industrial ecosystem , of a sense .
i was there because i was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program , under the u.n.
kyoto protocol system .
and as i was modeling this mangrove swamp , i was thinking to myself , &quot; how do you put a box around this ? &quot;
when i &apos;m modeling a plant in a box , literally , i know where to draw the boundary .
in a mangrove forest like this i have no idea .
well , of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the earth .
and understand its interactions with the entire earth .
and put your project in that context .
around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what i would call a biocidal species , one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
this is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the amazon .
and here the light green are areas of massive deforestation .
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
we &apos;re in the process of transforming from this , to what i would call a biophilic society , one where we learn to nurture society .
now it may not seem like it , but we are .
and i think often times people get lost in that .
they go , &quot; but how can i possibly find my way in that ?
and i would say that the small stuff counts . it really does .
this is the story of a rake in my backyard .
this was my backyard , very early on , when i bought my property .
and in arizona , of course , everybody puts gravel down .
and they like to keep everything beautifully raked . and they keep all the leaves away .
and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out , and i want to throttle them .
it &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
we &apos;re very uncomfortable with untidiness .
and i threw away my rake .
and i let all of the leaves fall from the trees that i have on my property .
and over time , essentially what have i been doing ?
i &apos;ve been building topsoil .
and so now all the birds come in . and i have hawks .
and i have an oasis .
this is what happens every spring . for six weeks , six to eight weeks , i have this flush of green oasis .
this is actually in a riparian area .
and all of tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake .
the small stuff counts .
the industrial revolution -- and prometheus -- has given us this , the ability to light up the world .
it has also given us this , the ability to look at the world from the outside .
now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to , and compare it to this biosphere .
but we can look at the world , and try to understand where we are in its context , and how we choose to interact with it .
the yogis had it right .
breath does , in fact , connect us all in a very literal way .
take a breath now .
and as you breathe , think about what is in your breath .
there perhaps is the co2 from the person sitting next-door to you .
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here .
it also connects us in time .
there may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs .
there could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren .
thank you .
jane poynter : life in biosphere 2
jane poynter tells her story of living two years and 20 minutes in biosphere 2 -- an experience that provoked her to explore how we might sustain life in the harshest of environments . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i got my start in writing and research as a surgical trainee , as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at anything .
so the natural question you ask then at that point is , how do i get good at what i &apos;m trying to do ?
and it became a question of , how do we all get good at what we &apos;re trying to do ?
it &apos;s hard enough to learn to get the skills , try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you &apos;re taking on .
i had to think about how i sew and how i cut , but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room .
and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good .
in the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis of medicine &apos;s existence due to something you don &apos;t normally think about when you &apos;re a doctor concerned with how you do good for people , which is the cost of health care .
there &apos;s not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do .
the political fight that we &apos;ve developed has become one around whether it &apos;s the government that &apos;s the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem .
and the answer is yes and no ; it &apos;s deeper than all of that .
and in order to understand this , i &apos;m going to take you back a couple of generations .
i want to take you back to a time when lewis thomas was writing in his book , &quot; the youngest science . &quot;
lewis thomas was a physician-writer , one of my favorite writers .
and he wrote this book to explain , among other things , what it was like to be a medical intern at the boston city hospital in the pre-penicillin year of 1937 .
it was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective .
if you were in a hospital , he said , it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth , some food , shelter , and maybe the caring attention of a nurse .
doctors and medicine made no difference at all .
that didn &apos;t seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days , as he explained .
what they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses for which they could do something .
and there were a few .
you might have a lobar pneumonia , for example , and they could give you an antiserum , an injection of rabid antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus , if the intern sub-typed it correctly .
if you had an acute congestive heart failure , they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein , giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent .
if you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions , you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis , in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic -- as long as you didn &apos;t overdose them and kill them .
beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn &apos;t have a lot that they could do .
this was when the core structure of medicine was created -- what it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be .
it was at a time when what was known you could know , you could hold it all in your head , and you could do it all .
if you had a prescription pad , if you had a nurse , if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce , maybe some basic tools , you really could do it all .
you set the fracture , you drew the blood , you spun the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you plated the culture , you injected the antiserum .
this was a life as a craftsman .
as a result , we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring , at being courageous , at being independent and self-sufficient .
autonomy was our highest value .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
we can &apos;t cure it all .
we can &apos;t guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life .
but we can make it possible for most .
but what does it take ?
well , we &apos;ve now discovered 4,000 medical and surgical procedures .
we &apos;ve discovered 6,000 drugs that i &apos;m now licensed to prescribe .
and we &apos;re trying to deploy this capability , town by town , to every person alive -- in our own country , let alone around the world .
and we &apos;ve reached the point where we &apos;ve realized , as doctors , we can &apos;t know it all .
we can &apos;t do it all by ourselves .
there was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital , as it changed over time .
and in the year 1970 , it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians .
that is to say , it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day .
by the end of the 20th century , it had become more than 15 clinicians for the same typical hospital patient -- specialists , physical therapists , the nurses .
we &apos;re all specialists now , even the primary care physicians .
everyone just has a piece of the care .
but holding onto that structure we built around the daring , independence , self-sufficiency of each of those people has become a disaster .
we have trained , hired and rewarded people to be cowboys .
but it &apos;s pit crews that we need , pit crews for patients .
there &apos;s evidence all around us : 40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
60 percent of our asthma , stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn &apos;t have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene .
our experience as people who get sick , need help from other people , is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to -- hardworking , incredibly well-trained and very smart -- that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope , but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way .
now we in medicine , i think , are baffled by this question of cost .
we want to say , &quot; this is just the way it is .
when you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin , that mostly didn &apos;t do the job , to one where , if it gets bad enough , we can do a hip replacement , a knee replacement that gives you years , maybe decades , without disability , a dramatic change , well is it any surprise that that $ 40,000 hip replacement replacing the 10-cent aspirin is more expensive ?
it &apos;s just the way it is .
but i think we &apos;re ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do .
as we &apos;ve looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased , we found that the most expensive care is not necessarily the best care .
and vice versa , the best care often turns out to be the least expensive -- has fewer complications , the people get more efficient at what they do .
and what that means is there &apos;s hope .
because &#91; if &#93; to have the best results , you really needed the most expensive care in the country , or in the world , well then we really would be talking about rationing who we &apos;re going to cut off from medicare .
that would be really our only choice .
but when we look at the positive deviants -- the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs -- we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful .
that is to say , they found ways all of the different components , to come together into a whole .
having great components is not enough , and yet we &apos;ve been obsessed in medicine with components .
we want the best drugs , the best technologies , the best specialists , but we don &apos;t think too much about how it all comes together .
it &apos;s a terrible design strategy actually .
there &apos;s a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said , what if you built a car from the very best car parts ?
well it would lead you to put in porsche brakes , a ferrari engine , a volvo body , a bmw chassis .
and you put it all together and what do you get ?
a very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
it &apos;s not a system .
now a system , however , when things start to come together , you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way .
you have to become really interested in data , unsexy as that sounds .
one of my colleagues is a surgeon in cedar rapids , iowa , and he got interested in the question of , well how many ct scans did they do for their community in cedar rapids ?
he got interested in this because there had been government reports , newspaper reports , journal articles saying that there had been too many ct scans done .
he didn &apos;t see it in his own patients .
and so he asked the question , &quot; how many did we do ? &quot;
and he wanted to get the data .
it took him three months .
no one had asked this question in his community before .
and what he found was that , for the 300,000 people in their community , in the previous year they had done 52,000 ct scans .
they had found a problem .
which brings us to skill number two a system has .
skill one , find where your failures are .
skill two is devise solutions .
i got interested in this when the world health organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery .
the volume of surgery had spread around the world , but the safety of surgery had not .
now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training , give people more specialization or bring in more technology .
well in surgery , you couldn &apos;t have people who are more specialized and you couldn &apos;t have people who are better trained .
and yet we see unconscionable levels of death , disability that could be avoided .
and so we looked at what other high-risk industries do .
we looked at skyscraper construction , we looked at the aviation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have checklists .
i did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a harvard surgeon worrying about checklists .
and yet , what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better .
could we design a checklist for surgery ?
not for the lowest people on the totem pole , but for the folks who were all the way around the chain , the entire team including the surgeons .
and what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than i had understood .
you have to think about things like pause points .
you need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it &apos;s a danger and do something about it .
you have to identify that this is a before-takeoff checklist .
and then you need to focus on the killer items .
an aviation checklist , like this one for a single-engine plane , isn &apos;t a recipe for how to fly a plane , it &apos;s a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they &apos;re not checked .
so we did this .
we created a 19-item two-minute checklist for surgical teams .
we had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given , immediately before the knife hits the skin , immediately before the patient leaves the room .
and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff , because you can &apos;t make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery .
instead , you can make a recipe for how to have a team that &apos;s prepared for the unexpected .
and we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day , because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you &apos;re coming in .
we implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world , deliberately in places from rural tanzania to the university of washington in seattle .
we found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell 35 percent .
it fell in every hospital it went into .
the death rates fell 47 percent .
this was bigger than a drug .
and that brings us to skill number three , the ability to implement this , to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
this is not yet our norm in surgery -- let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas .
just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we &apos;ve had , like humility , discipline , teamwork .
this is the opposite of what we were built on : independence , self-sufficiency , autonomy .
i met an actual cowboy , by the way .
i asked him , what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles ?
how did you do that ?
and he said , &quot; we have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around . &quot;
they communicate electronically constantly , and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything -- -- from bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists .
but i would go further and say that making systems work , whether in health care , education , climate change , making a pathway out of poverty , is the great task of our generation as a whole .
in every field , knowledge has exploded , but it has brought complexity , it has brought specialization .
and we &apos;ve come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize , as individualistic as we want to be , complexity requires group success .
we all need to be pit crews now .
thank you .
atul gawande : how do we heal medicine ?
our medical systems are broken . doctors are capable of extraordinary treatments , but they are losing their core focus : actually treating people . doctor and writer atul gawande suggests we take a step back and look at new ways to do medicine -- with fewer cowboys and more pit crews .
what i &apos;d like you to do is , just really quickly , is just , sort of , nod to the person on your right , and then nod to the person on your left .
now , chances are that over the last winter , if you had been a beehive , either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died .
now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
and this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent of the colonies , or we estimate we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
we know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses , and we also have this new phenomenon , which i talked about last year , colony collapse disorder .
and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december .
and below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the colonies are brought in until february , and then they &apos;re shipped out to the almonds .
and one documentary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after i was here , described this not as beehives but as a graveyard , with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .
now , i &apos;m going to sum up a year &apos;s worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is .
and what we know is that it &apos;s as if the bees have caught a flu .
and this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
in some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called israeli acute paralysis virus .
it was called that because a guy in israel first found it , and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease , because , of course , there &apos;s the implication .
but we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
it &apos;s also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus , and so the question we &apos;re still struggling with , and the question that keeps us up at night , is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu , and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases ?
and we don &apos;t have the answer to that yet , and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out .
we think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
we know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that , you know , we &apos;re finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive , and surprisingly , sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides . and so we discover all these very strange things that we can &apos;t begin to understand .
and so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health .
now of course , if you lose a lot of colonies , beekeepers can replace them very quickly .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;ve been able to recover from a lot of loss .
if we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the national guard would be out .
but what beekeepers can do is , if they have one surviving colony , they can split that colony in two .
and then the one half that doesn &apos;t have a queen , they can buy a queen .
it comes in the mail ; it can come from australia or hawaii or florida , and you can introduce that queen .
and in fact , america was the first country that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact , it &apos;s part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country .
and you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out .
so it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those losses .
so even though we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the colonies every year , the same number of colonies have existed in the country , at about 2.4 million colonies .
now , those losses are tragic on many fronts , and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper .
and it &apos;s really important to talk about beekeepers first , because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you &apos;ll ever meet .
if this was a group of beekeepers , you would have everyone from the card-carrying nra member who &apos;s , you know , live free or die , to the , you know , the self-expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer .
and you get all of these people in the same room , and they &apos;re all engaged and they &apos;re getting along , and they &apos;re all there because of the passion for bees .
now , there &apos;s another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers , the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone .
and these tend to be some of the most independent , tenacious , intuitive , you know , inventive people you will ever meet .
they &apos;re just fascinating . and they &apos;re like that all over the world .
i had the privilege of working in haiti just for two weeks earlier this year .
and haiti , if you &apos;ve ever been there , is just a tragedy .
i mean , there may be 100 explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor .
but you meet this beekeeper , and i met this beekeeper here , and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers i &apos;ve ever met .
no formal education , but very knowledgeable .
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on ; he was so capable , he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung , tin cans and his veil , which he used as a screening , right in this meadow . and so that ingenuity is inspiring .
we also have dave hackenberg , who is the poster child of ccd .
he &apos;s the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells .
and he has a history of these trucks , and he &apos;s moved these bees up and down the coast .
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we &apos;ve done that for thousands of years .
the ancient egyptians used to move bees up and down the nile on rafts , so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all .
and one of our real worries with colony collapse disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies .
and that &apos;s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
and these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of america .
you know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
and if you look at florida , in dade city , florida , that &apos;s where all the pennsylvania beekeepers go .
and then 20 miles down the road is groveland , and that &apos;s where all the wisconsin beekeepers go .
and if you &apos;re ever in central valley in february , you go to this café at 10 o &apos;clock in the morning , kathy and kate &apos;s .
and that &apos;s where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves .
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . and it &apos;s a great experience , and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that &apos;s quite essential american experience .
and we see these families , these nomadic families , you know , father to son , father to son , and these guys are hurting .
and they &apos;re not people who like to ask for help , although they are the most helpful people ever .
if there &apos;s one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul , everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives to help him replace those lost colonies .
and so , it &apos;s a very dynamic , and i think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
of course , the real importance for bees is not the honey .
and although i highly encourage you , all use honey .
i mean , it &apos;s the most ethical sweetener , and you know , it &apos;s a dynamic and fun sweetener .
but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees .
now , i want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast i had yesterday morning -- a little cranberry juice , some fruits , some granola , i should have had whole wheat bread , i realized , but you know , jam on my wonderbread , and some coffee -- and had we taken out all those ingredients , -- except for the almonds i wasn &apos;t going to pick out from the granola -- if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated , we wouldn &apos;t have much on our plate .
it &apos;s said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .
and that &apos;s a really great expression , because really , bees are the sex workers for flowers . they are , you know -- they get paid for their services .
they get paid by pollen and nectar , to move that male sperm , the pollen , from flower to flower .
and there are flowers that are self-infertile . that means they can &apos;t -- the pollen in their bloom can &apos;t fertilize themselves .
so in an apple orchard , for instance , you &apos;ll have rows of 10 apples of one variety , and then you have another apple tree that &apos;s a different type of pollen .
when they &apos;re out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower , they stay to that crop exclusively , in order to help generate .
and of course , they &apos;re made to carry this pollen .
they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom .
however , honeybees are a minority .
honeybees are not native to america ; they were introduced with the colonialists .
and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined .
in pennsylvania alone , we have been surveying bees for 150 years , and very intensely in the last three years .
we have identified over 400 species of bees in pennsylvania .
thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950 .
now , that could be because we haven &apos;t been sampling right , but it does , i think , suggest that something &apos;s wrong with the pollinator force . and these bees are fascinating .
we have bumblebees on the top .
and bumblebees are what we call eusocial : they &apos;re not truly social , because only the queen is , over winter .
we also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
they &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
and then you have another type of bee , which we call kleptoparasites , which is a very fancy way of saying , bad-minded , murdering -- what &apos;s the word i &apos;m looking for ? murdering -- audience : bee ?
dennis vanengelsdorp : bee . okay , thanks .
what these bees do is , they sit there . these solitary bees , they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch , and they collect pollen and make it into a ball , and they lay an egg on it .
well , these bees hang out at that hole , and they wait for that mother to fly away , they go in , eat the egg , and lay their own egg there . so they don &apos;t do any work .
and so , in fact , if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they &apos;re top-of-the-food-chain bees .
and in fact , there is now a red list of pollinators that we &apos;re worried have disappeared , and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites , but also these bumblebees .
and in fact , if you guys live on the west coast , go to these websites here , and they &apos;re really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees , because we think some have gone extinct . or some , the population has declined .
and so it &apos;s not just honeybees that are in trouble , but we don &apos;t understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community .
there are other animals that pollinate , like bats , and bats are in trouble too .
and i &apos;m glad i &apos;m a bee man and not a bat man , because there &apos;s no money to research the bat problems .
and bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
white-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
if there &apos;s a cave in new york that had 15,000 bats in it , and there are 1,000 left . that &apos;s like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years .
and so that &apos;s incredible . and there &apos;s no money to do that .
but i &apos;m glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions , and that cause is ndd : nature deficit disorder .
and that is that i think that what we have in our society is , we forgot our connection with nature .
and i think if we reconnect to nature , we &apos;ll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
and that is , make meadows and not lawns .
and i think we have lost our connection , and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment .
i &apos;ve had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while , and it is terribly engaging .
and if we look at the history of lawns , it &apos;s actually rather tragic .
it used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a lawn was a symbol of prestige , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , deserts : they &apos;re totally sterile .
americans spent , in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns .
five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns .
and so it &apos;s incredible the amount of resources we &apos;ve spent keeping our lawns , which are these useless biosystems .
and so we need to rethink this idea .
in fact , you know , the white house used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in world war i , which probably is not a bad idea ; it wouldn &apos;t be a bad idea .
i want to say this not because i &apos;m opposed completely to mowing lawns .
i think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale , and i think we &apos;re encouraged to do that .
that it is amazing that connection we can have with what &apos;s there .
these milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years . add to watch the different plants , or insects , that come to these flowers , to watch that -- and we &apos;ve heard about , you know , this relationship you can have with wine , this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances .
and this is a companion , and this is a relationship that never dries up .
you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine , too .
and i encourage you to look at that .
now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
bees apparently , can be the gateway to , you know , other things .
so i &apos;m not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot , but a pot in a meadow .
but you can also have this great community of city or building-top beekeepers , these beekeepers that live -- this is in paris where these beekeepers live .
and everyone should open a beehive , because it is the most amazing , incredible thing .
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd , or nature deficit disorder , i think this is a great way of doing it .
get a beehive and grow a meadow , and watch that life come back into your life .
and so with that , i think that what we can do , if we do this , we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future -- includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows .
and that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one .
and i hope that you experience it and i hope you tell me about it one day .
so thank you very much for being here . thank you very much .
dennis vanengelsdorp : a plea for bees
bees are dying in droves . why ? leading apiarist dennis vanengelsdorp looks at the gentle , misunderstood creature &apos;s important place in nature and the mystery behind its alarming disappearance .
thank you .
that was whistling .
i &apos;m trying to do this in english .
what is a chubby , curly-haired guy from holland -- why is he whistling ?
my dad was always whistling around the house , and i just thought that &apos;s part of communication in my family .
so i whistled along with him .
and actually , till i was 34 , i always annoyed and irritated people with whistling , because , to be honest , my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior .
i whistled alone . i whistled in the classroom .
i whistled on &#91; my &#93; bike . i whistled everywhere .
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family-in-law .
and when i hear music that i don &apos;t like , i try to make it better .
so &quot; rudolph the red-nosed reindeer &quot; -- you know it ?
but it can also sound like this .
but during a christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it &apos;s very annoying .
so my sister-in-law asked me a few times , &quot; please stop whistling . &quot;
and i just couldn &apos;t .
and at one point -- and i had some wine , i have to admit that -- at one point i said , &quot; if there was a contest , i would join . &quot;
and two weeks later i received a text message : &quot; you &apos;re going to america . &quot;
so , okay , i &apos;m going to america .
i would love to , but why ?
so i immediately called her up , of course .
she googled , and she found this world whistling championship in america , of course .
she didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
and i would have lost my face .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s correct english .
but the dutch people here will understand what i mean .
and she thought , &quot; he will never go there . &quot;
but actually i did .
so i went to louisburg , north carolina , southeast united states , and i entered the world of whistling .
and i also entered the world championship , and i won there in 2004 .
that was great fun , of course .
and to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- i thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and i won again .
then i couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
and in 2008 i entered again in japan , tokyo , and i won again .
so what happened now is i &apos;m standing here in rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and i &apos;m talking about whistling .
and actually i earn my money whistling at the moment .
so i quit my day job as a nurse .
and i try to live my dream -- well , actually , it was never my dream , but it sounds so good .
okay , i &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
you say , &quot; huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
well actually , you are going to whistle along .
and then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , &quot; oh , my god .
why ? can i go away ? &quot;
no , you can &apos;t .
actually it &apos;s very simple .
the track that i will whistle is called &quot; fête de la belle . &quot;
it &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
no , no , no . it &apos;s four minutes long .
so i whistle the tone .
sorry . i forgot one thing .
you whistle the same tone as me .
i heard a wide variety of tones .
this is very promising .
this is very promising .
i &apos;ll ask the technicians to start the music .
and if it &apos;s started , i just point where you whistle along , and we will see what happens .
oh , hah .
i &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
i &apos;m so used to that .
i start it myself .
okay , here it is .
okay .
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself .
max westerman : geert chatrou , the world champion &#91; of &#93; whistling .
geert chatrou : thank you . thank you .
geert chatrou : a whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
in this engaging talk , world champion whistler geert chatrou performs the whimsical &quot; eleonora &quot; by a. honhoff , and his own &quot; fête de la belle . &quot; in a fascinating interlude , he talks about what brought him to the craft . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
sometimes i go browsing &#91; through &#93; a very old magazine .
i found this observation test about the story of the ark .
and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors , had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes .
there is a funnel , an aerial part , a lamp and clockwork key on the ark .
some of them are about the animals , the number .
but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that &apos;s not reported here .
and this problem is : where are the plants ?
so now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently or at least for a very long period , and no one is taking care of plants .
noah needed to take two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal , of every kind of creature that moves , but no mention about plants .
why ?
in another part of the same story , all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark , so birds , livestock and wild animals .
plants are not living creatures -- this is the point .
that is a point that is not coming out from the bible , but it &apos;s something that really accompanied humanity .
let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book .
here we have the description of the order of nature .
it &apos;s a nice description because it &apos;s starting from left -- you have the stones -- immediately after the stones , the plants that are just able to live .
we have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyramid , there is the man .
this is not the common man .
the &quot; homo studiosus &quot; -- the studying man .
this is quite comforting for people like me -- i &apos;m a professor -- this to be over there on the top of creation .
but it &apos;s something completely wrong .
you know very well about professors .
but it &apos;s also wrong about plants , because plants are not just able to live ; they are able to sense .
they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals .
just to give you an example , every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters .
well , but this is something -- this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us .
let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
we have david attenborough .
now david attenborough is really a plant lover ; he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior .
now , when he speaks about plants , everything is correct .
when he speaks about animals , &#91; he &#93; tends to remove the fact that plants exist .
the blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong , completely wrong .
the blue whale , it &apos;s a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is , this wonderful , magnificent sequoiadendron giganteum .
and this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons .
now , the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle , that in &quot; de anima &quot; -- that is a very influential book for the western civilization -- wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living .
they have just a kind of very low-level soul .
it &apos;s called the vegetative soul , because they lack movement , and so they don &apos;t need to sense .
let &apos;s see .
okay , some of the movements of the plants are very well-known .
this is a very fast movement .
this is a dionaea , a venus fly trap hunting snails -- sorry for the snail .
this has been something that has been refused for centuries , despite the evidence .
no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal , because it was against the order of nature .
but plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
some of them are very well known , like the flowering .
it &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
some of them are much more sophisticated .
and it &apos;s really so graceful ; it &apos;s like a dancing angel .
they are also able to play -- they are really playing .
these are young sunflowers , and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing .
they are training themselves , as many young animals do , to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day .
they are able to respond to gravity , of course , so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity .
but they are also able to sleep .
this is one , mimosa pudica .
so during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
this is interesting because this sleeping machinery , it &apos;s perfectly conserved .
it &apos;s the same in plants , in insects and in animals .
and so if you need to study this sleeping problem , it &apos;s easy to study on plants , for example , than in animals and it &apos;s much more easy even ethically .
it &apos;s a kind of vegetarian experimentation .
plants are even able to communicate -- they are extraordinary communicators .
they communicate with other plants .
they communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles , for example , during the pollination .
now with the pollination , it &apos;s a very serious issue for plants , because they move the pollen from one flower to the other , yet they cannot move from one flower to the other .
so they need a vector -- and this vector , it &apos;s normally an animal .
many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination , but not just insects ; even birds , reptiles , and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .
this is a serious business .
we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance -- very energizing -- having in change this transportation of the pollen .
but some plants are manipulating animals , like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen .
now , there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen .
we need to wait until 1880 , when this big man , charles darwin , publishes a wonderful , astonishing book that starts a revolution .
the title is &quot; the power of movement in plants . &quot;
no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin .
in his book , assisted by his son , francis -- who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world , in cambridge -- they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages .
and in the last paragraph of the book , it &apos;s a kind of stylistic mark , because normally charles darwin stored , in the last paragraph of a book , the most important message .
he wrote that , &quot; it &apos;s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot;
this is not a metaphor .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j.d. hooker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
now , this is a root apex growing against a slope .
so you can recognize this kind of movement , the same movement that worms , snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display .
and it &apos;s not an easy movement because , to have this kind of movement , you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain .
so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here , depicted in blue -- that is called the &quot; transition zone . &quot;
and this region , it &apos;s a very small region -- it &apos;s less than one millimeter .
and in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important , you have these kinds of signals here .
the signals that you are seeing here are action potential , are the same signals that the neurons of my brain , of our brain , use to exchange information .
now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature , but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant , like a plant of rye .
we have almost 14 million roots .
we have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
now let &apos;s imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others .
here were have on the left , the internet and on the right , the root apparatus .
they work in the same way .
they are a network of small computing machines , working in networks .
because they evolved for the same reason : to survive predation .
they work in the same way .
so you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants &#91; continue &#93; to work .
you can remove 90 percent of the internet and it is &#91; continuing &#93; to work .
so , a suggestion for the people working with networks : plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks .
and another possibility is a technological possibility .
let &apos;s imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants .
until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
we have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals , insectoid , so on .
we have the androids that are inspired by man .
but why have we not any plantoid ?
well , if you want to fly , it &apos;s good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds .
but if you want to explore soils , or if you want to colonize new territory , to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .
we have another possibility we are working &#91; on &#93; in our lab , &#91; which &#93; is to build hybrids .
it &apos;s much more easy to build hybrids .
hybrid means it &apos;s something that &apos;s half living and half machine .
it &apos;s much more easy to work with plants than with animals .
they have computing power , they have electrical signals .
the connection with the machine is much more easy , much more even ethically possible .
and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids , driven by algae or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
well , thank you for your attention .
and before i finish , i would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation .
stefano mancuso : the roots of plant intelligence
plants behave in some oddly intelligent ways : fighting predators , maximizing food opportunities ... but can we think of them as actually having a form of intelligence of their own ? italian botanist stefano mancuso presents intriguing evidence .
i started improv everywhere about 10 years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy .
because i was new to the city , i didn &apos;t have access to a stage , so i decided to create my own in public places .
so the first project we &apos;re going to take a look at is the very first no pants subway ride .
now this took place in january of 2002 .
and this woman is the star of the video .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
she &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
this is on the 6 train in new york city .
and this is the first stop along the line .
these are two danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera .
and that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
it &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
i &apos;m wearing a hat . i &apos;m wearing a scarf .
and the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
and as you &apos;ll see now , i &apos;m not wearing pants .
so at this point -- at this point she &apos;s noticed me , but in new york there &apos;s weirdos on any given train car .
one person &apos;s not that unusual .
she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled &quot; rape . &quot;
so she &apos;s noticed the unusual thing , but she &apos;s gone back to her normal life .
now in the meantime , i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well .
we &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
and we &apos;ll act as if it &apos;s just an unfortunate mistake we &apos;ve made , forgetting our pants on this cold january day .
and she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings .
now in the meantime , the two danish guys to the left of the camera , they &apos;re cracking up .
they think this is the funniest thing they &apos;ve ever seen before .
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
and i love that moment in this video , because before it became a shared experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit scary , or something that was at least confusing to her .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
so the video won &apos;t show everything .
this goes on for another four stops .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; thank you . that &apos;s exactly what i needed today , &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
thank you .
so that &apos;s a still from the video there .
and i love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people .
it &apos;s a prank , but it &apos;s a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride .
and we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
this january , we did the 10th annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in new york -- almost every single train line in the city .
as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians , i started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
so i could do more large-scale projects .
well one day i was walking through union square , and i saw this building , which had just been built in 2005 .
and there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing .
and it was very peculiar , because it was dark out , but she was back-lit with florescent lighting , and she was very much onstage , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why she was doing it .
after about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this .
so i got inspired by that .
looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do .
so this project is called look up more . we had 70 actors dress in black .
this was completely unauthorized .
we didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
and i stood in the park giving signals .
the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out &quot; look up more , &quot; the name of the project .
the second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together .
you &apos;ll see that start right here .
and then we had dancing . we had everyone dance .
and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
so then i gave a new hand signal , which signaled the next soloist down below in forever 21 , and he danced .
there were several other activities .
we had people jumping up and down , people dropping to the ground .
and i was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt , putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement .
there &apos;s a better photo of it .
so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to stumble upon .
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
a high school kid in texas wrote me in 2006 and said , &quot; you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around . &quot;
so i wrote this high school kid back immediately , and i said , &quot; yes , you are correct .
i think i &apos;ll try to do that this weekend . thank you . &quot;
so here &apos;s the video .
so again , this is 2005 .
this is the best buy in new york city .
we had about 80 people show up to participate , entering one-by-one .
there was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
there was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
so a very diverse group of people .
and i told people , &quot; don &apos;t work . don &apos;t actually do work .
but also , don &apos;t shop .
just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt .
everybody else is one of our actors .
the lower level employees thought it was very funny .
and in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
you can see them in this footage .
and we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming , watch out , the cops were coming .
and you can see the cops in this footage right here .
that &apos;s a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
ultimately , the police had to inform best buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
so we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop .
so i like that concept of using their own technology against them .
i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason .
and one morning , i was riding the subway .
i had to make a transfer at the 53rd st. stop where there are these two giant escalators .
and it &apos;s a very depressing place to be in the morning , it &apos;s very crowded .
so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning .
so this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8 : 30 in the morning .
it &apos;s morning rush hour .
it &apos;s very cold outside .
people are coming in from queens , transferring from the e train to the 6 train .
and they &apos;re going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
thank you .
so there &apos;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
so i &apos;d say over the years , one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is : &quot; these people have too much time on their hands . &quot;
and you know , not everybody &apos;s going to like everything you do , and i &apos;ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments , but that one &apos;s always bothered me , because we don &apos;t have too much time on our hands .
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
you know , every saturday and sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games .
and i &apos;ve never seen anybody comment , looking at a football game , saying , &quot; all those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . &quot;
and of course they don &apos;t .
it &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
but i think it &apos;s also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library .
or listening to the same mp3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park , or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical , or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire .
you know , as kids , we &apos;re taught to play .
and we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
it &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
and i think that &apos;s sort of the point of improv everywhere .
it &apos;s that there is no point and that there doesn &apos;t have to be a point .
we don &apos;t need a reason .
as long as it &apos;s fun and it seems like it &apos;s going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that &apos;s enough for us .
and i think , as adults , we need to learn that there &apos;s no right or wrong way to play .
charlie todd : the shared experience of absurdity
charlie todd causes bizarre , hilarious , and unexpected public scenes : seventy synchronized dancers in storefront windows , &quot; ghostbusters &quot; running through the new york public library , and the annual no-pants subway ride . in his talk , he shows how his group , improv everywhere , uses these scenes to bring people together . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over 50 years last october .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
we &apos;ve gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage , but we still can &apos;t do that with water , and here &apos;s why .
right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained technician , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
it &apos;s too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change , too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing .
and it ignores the fact that , in the meanwhile , people still need to drink water .
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn &apos;t come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines -- a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they &apos;re safe .
i &apos;ve been inspired by that simplicity as i &apos;ve been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i &apos;ve ever known .
we think there &apos;s a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
we call it the water canary .
it &apos;s a fast , cheap device that answers an important question : is this water contaminated ?
it doesn &apos;t require any special training .
and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place , it uses light .
that means there &apos;s no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
to test water , you simply insert a sample and , within seconds , it either displays a red light , indicating contaminated water , or a green light , indicating the sample is safe .
this will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold .
we &apos;re also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm .
what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time .
with enough users , maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action , containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from .
and then , instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most , it can happen automatically .
we &apos;ve seen how distributed networks , big data and information can transform society .
i think it &apos;s time for us to apply them to water .
thank you .
sonaar luthra : meet the water canary
after a crisis , how can we tell if water is safe to drink ? current tests are slow and complex , and the delay can be deadly , as in the cholera outbreak after haiti &apos;s earthquake in 2010 . fellow sonaar luthra previews his design for a simple tool that quickly tests water for safety -- the water canary .
it &apos;s wonderful to be back .
i love this wonderful gathering .
and you must be wondering , &quot; what on earth ?
have they put up the wrong slide ? &quot;
no , no .
look at this magnificent beast and ask the question -- who designed it ?
this is ted .
this is technology , entertainment , design and there &apos;s a dairy cow .
it &apos;s a quite wonderfully designed animal .
and i was thinking , how do i introduce this ?
and i thought , well , maybe that old doggerel by joyce kilmer , you know : &quot; poems are made by fools like me , but only god can make a tree . &quot;
and you might say , &quot; well , god designed the cow . &quot;
but , of course , god got a lot of help .
this is the ancestor of cattle .
this is the oryx .
and it was designed by natural selection , the process of natural selection , over many millions of years .
and then it became domesticated thousands of years ago .
and human beings became its stewards , and , without even knowing what they were doing , they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it .
and then , more recently , they really began to do sort of reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were , how they worked and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better .
because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions .
religions are natural phenomena .
they &apos;re just as natural as cows .
they have evolved over millennia .
they have a biological base , just like the oryx .
they have become domesticated , and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years .
this is ted , and i want to talk about design .
because what i &apos;ve been doing for the last four years , really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion , and in the last four years i &apos;ve been working just about non-stop on this topic .
and you might say it &apos;s about the reverse engineering of religions .
now that very idea , i think , strikes terror in many people , or anger , or anxiety of one sort or another .
and that is the spell that i want to break .
i want to say , no , religions are an important natural phenomenon .
we should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena , like global warming , as we heard so eloquently last night from al gore .
today &apos;s religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed .
they &apos;re immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering .
and , as with the cow , there &apos;s a mixture of evolutionary design , designed by natural selection itself , and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions .
you don &apos;t do book talks at ted , but i &apos;m going to have just one slide about my book , because there is one message in it which i think this group really needs to hear .
and i would be very interested to get your responses to this .
it &apos;s the one policy proposal that i make in the book , at this time when i claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make .
and it &apos;s one that echoes remarks that you &apos;ve heard already today .
here &apos;s my proposal .
i &apos;m going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it -- education in world religions , on world religions , for all of our children in primary school , in high school , in public schools , in private schools and in home schooling .
and as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
that , i think , is maximal tolerance for religious freedom .
as long as you inform your children about other religions , then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like -- teach them whatever creed you want them to learn .
but also let them know about other religions .
now why do i say that ?
because democracy depends on an informed citizenship .
informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy .
misinformed consent is not worth it .
it &apos;s like a coin flip ; it doesn &apos;t count really .
democracy depends on informed consent .
this is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
i &apos;m going to use a word that pastor rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children .
they don &apos;t own them .
you can &apos;t own your children .
you have a responsibility to the world , to the state , to them , to take care of them right .
you may teach them whatever creed you think is most important , but i say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world , too .
the reason i &apos;ve taken this time is i &apos;ve been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this .
one reviewer for a roman catholic newspaper called it &quot; totalitarian . &quot;
it strikes me as practically libertarian .
is it totalitarian to require reading , writing and arithmetic ?
i don &apos;t think so .
no values , just facts about all the world &apos;s religions .
another reviewer called it &quot; hilarious . &quot;
well , i &apos;m really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious .
it seems to me to be such a plausible , natural extension of the democratic principles we already have , that i &apos;m shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous .
i know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s defensible , but i &apos;d really be pleased to get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later .
but now i &apos;m going to move on .
back to the cow .
this picture , which i pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .
that &apos;s the steward .
cows couldn &apos;t live without human stewards -- they &apos;re domesticated .
they &apos;re a sort of ectosymbiont .
they depend on us for their survival .
and pastor rick was just talking about sheep .
i &apos;m going to talk about sheep , too .
there &apos;s a lot of serendipitous convergence here .
how clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds !
think of what this got them .
they could outsource all their problems -- protection from predators , food finding , health maintenance .
the only cost in most flocks is a loss of free mating .
what a deal .
&quot; how clever of sheep ! &quot; you might say .
we all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they &apos;re not very smart .
it wasn &apos;t the cleverness of the sheep at all .
they were clueless .
but it was a very clever move .
whose clever move was it ?
it was a clever move of natural selection itself .
francis crick , the co-discoverer of the structure of dna with jim watson , once joked about what he called orgel &apos;s second rule .
leslie orgel is still a molecular biologist , brilliant guy , and orgel &apos;s second rule is : evolution is cleverer than you are .
now , that is not intelligent design -- not from francis crick .
evolution is cleverer than you are .
if you understand orgel &apos;s second rule , then you understand why the intelligent design movement is basically a hoax .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what &apos;s discovered .
but the process itself is without purpose , without foresight , without design .
when i was here four years ago , i told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass .
and why was the ant doing it ?
well , it &apos;s because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .
it was sort of a spooky story .
and i think some people may have misunderstood .
lancet flukes aren &apos;t smart .
i submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there somewhere between petunia and carrot .
they &apos;re not really bright . they don &apos;t have to be .
the design is there in nature , but it &apos;s not in anybody &apos;s head .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
the question -- was domestication good for sheep ?
it was great for their genetic fitness .
and here i want to remind you of a wonderful point that paul maccready made at ted three years ago .
here &apos;s what he said .
10,000 years ago at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tenth of one per cent of the terrestrial vertebrae landmass .
that was just 10,000 years ago .
yesterday , in biological terms .
what is it today ? does anybody remember what he told us ?
98 percent .
that is what we have done on this planet .
now , i talked to paul afterwards .
i wanted to check to find out how he &apos;d calculated this , and get the sources and so forth .
and he gave me a paper that he had written on this .
there was a passage in it which he did not present here and i think it is so good i &apos;m going to read it to you .
&quot; over billions of years on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life : complex , improbable , wonderful and fragile .
suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .
we now wield the paintbrush . &quot;
we heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish .
life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet .
and we &apos;re the ones that hold the paintbrush .
the key to our domination of the planet is culture , and the key to culture is religion .
suppose martian scientists came to earth .
they would be puzzled by many things .
anybody know what this is ?
i &apos;ll tell you what it is .
this is a million people gathering on the banks of the ganges in 2001 , perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever , as seen from satellite photograph .
here &apos;s a big crowd .
here &apos;s another crowd in mecca .
martians would be amazed by this .
they &apos;d want to know how it originated , what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .
actually , i &apos;m going to pass over this .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
there &apos;s all sorts of wonderful cases of species .
in that case , a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .
and it turns the mouse into mighty mouse -- it makes it fearless , so it runs out in the open , where it &apos;ll be eaten by a cat .
true story .
in other words , we have these hijackers -- you &apos;ve seen this slide before , from four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fitness .
does that ever happen to us ?
yes , it does -- quite wonderfully .
the arabic word &quot; islam &quot; means &quot; submission . &quot;
it means &quot; surrender of self-interest to the will of allah . &quot;
but i &apos;m not just talking about islam .
this is a parchment music page that i found in a paris bookstall 50 years ago .
and on it it says , in latin : the word of god is the seed and the sower of the seed is christ . &quot;
same idea ! well , not quite .
but in fact , christians , too , glory in the fact that they have surrendered to god .
i &apos;ll give you a few quotes .
&quot; the heart of worship is surrender .
surrendered people obey god &apos;s words , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
those words are by rick warren .
those are from &quot; the purpose driven life . &quot;
and i want to turn now , briefly , to talk about that book , which i &apos;ve read .
you &apos;ve all got a copy .
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint , because i think it &apos;s actually a brilliant book .
first of all , the goal .
and you heard just now what the goal is .
it &apos;s to bring purpose to the lives of millions , and he has succeeded .
is it a good goal ?
in itself , i &apos;m sure we all agree , it is a wonderful goal .
he &apos;s absolutely right .
there are lots of people out there who don &apos;t have purpose in their life , and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal .
i give him an a + on this .
is the goal achieved ?
30 million copies of this book .
al gore , eat your heart out .
just exactly what al is trying to do , rick is doing .
this is a fantastic achievement .
and , the means -- how does he do it ?
it &apos;s a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes -- updating them , quietly dropping obsolete features , putting new interpretations on other features .
this is the evolution of religion that &apos;s been going on for thousands of years , and he &apos;s just the latest brilliant practitioner of it .
i don &apos;t have to tell you this .
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
excellent insights into human psychology , wise advice on every page .
moreover , he invites us to look under the hood .
i really appreciated that .
for instance , he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different bible verses .
the book is clear , vivid , accessible , beautifully formatted .
just enough repetition .
that &apos;s really important .
every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
with me , everybody -- every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
thank you .
and now we come to my problem .
because i &apos;m absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that i &apos;ve said about this book .
i have some problems with the book .
and it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems .
i wish he could do this with a revision , a mark 2 version of his book .
&quot; the truth will set you free &quot; -- that &apos;s what it says in the bible , and it &apos;s something that i want to live by , too .
my problem is , some of the bits in it i don &apos;t think are true .
now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that &apos;s not my main complaint .
that &apos;s worth mentioning .
here &apos;s a passage -- it &apos;s very much what he said , anyway .
&quot; if there was no god we would all be accidents , the result of astronomical random chance in the universe .
you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .
there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on earth . &quot;
now , i just do not believe that .
by the way , i find homer groening &apos;s film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim .
yes , there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong .
we don &apos;t need a belief in god to be good or to have meaning in us .
but that is just a difference of opinion .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m really worried about .
how about this -- &quot; god designed this planet &apos;s environment just so we could live in it . &quot;
i &apos;m afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don &apos;t have to do the sorts of things that al gore is trying so hard to get us to do .
i &apos;m not happy with that sentiment at all .
and then i find this -- &quot; all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact . &quot;
well , that &apos;s michael denton . he &apos;s a creationist .
i read this again .
i read it three or four times and i think , &quot; is he really endorsing intelligent design ?
is he endorsing creationism here ? &quot;
and you can &apos;t tell .
so i &apos;m sort of thinking , &quot; well , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know if i want to get upset with this yet . &quot;
but then i read on and i read this : &quot; first , noah had never seen rain , because prior to the flood god irrigated the earth from the ground up . &quot;
i wish that sentence weren &apos;t in there , because i think it is false .
and i think that thinking this way about the history of the planet , after we &apos;ve just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years , discourages people from scientific understanding .
now , rick warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way .
here &apos;s one : &quot; god deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique .
he carefully mixed the dna cocktail that created you . &quot;
i think that &apos;s false .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
here &apos;s another one -- &quot; for instance , your brain can store 100 trillion facts .
your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second . &quot;
well , it would be interesting to find the interpretation where i would accept that .
there might be some way of treating that as true .
&quot; anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge , hardwired by god into the very fiber of our being , an inbuilt need to connect with god . &quot;
well , there &apos;s a sense which i agree with him , except i think it has an evolutionary explanation .
and what i find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral , if you want to have meaning in your life , you have to be an intelligent designer -- you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection .
and i think , on the contrary , that it is very important to solving the world &apos;s problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously .
whose truth are we going to listen to ?
well maybe , ok , but what &apos;s going to follow from this ?
and here &apos;s one that does concern me .
remember i quoted him before with this line -- &quot; surrendered people obey god &apos;s word , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
and that &apos;s a problem .
&quot; don &apos;t ever argue with the devil .
he &apos;s better at arguing than you are , having had thousands of years to practice . &quot;
now rick warren didn &apos;t invent this clever move .
it &apos;s an old move .
it &apos;s a very clever adaptation of religions .
it &apos;s a wildcard for disarming any reasonable criticism .
&quot; you don &apos;t like my interpretation ?
you &apos;ve got a reasonable objection to it ?
don &apos;t listen , don &apos;t listen !
that &apos;s the devil speaking . &quot;
this discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have .
i &apos;ve got one more problem , then i &apos;m through .
and i &apos;d really like to get a response if rick is able to do it .
&quot; in the great commission , jesus said , &apos; go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples . baptize them in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit , and teach them to do everything i &apos;ve told you . &apos; &quot; the bible says jesus is the only one who can save the world .
now here we &apos;ve seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so .
here &apos;s one , not as beautiful as the others .
it simply shows the religions of the world .
and here &apos;s one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions .
it seems to me that that &apos;s a very problematic ship to get on for the future .
i found this sign as i was driving to maine recently , in front of a church -- &quot; good without god becomes zero . &quot;
sort of cute .
a very clever little meme .
i don &apos;t believe it and i think this idea , popular as it is -- not in this guise but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face .
if you are like me , you know many wonderful , committed , engaged atheists , agnostics , who are being very good without god .
and you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works .
so , i wish we could drop this meme .
i wish this meme would go extinct .
thanks very much for your attention .
philosopher dan dennett calls for religion -- all religion -- to be taught in schools , so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon . then he takes on the purpose-driven life , disputing its claim that , to be moral , one must deny evolution .
the hindus say , &quot; nada brahma , &quot; one translation of which is , &quot; the world is sound . &quot;
in fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .
every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .
so you are , in fact , a chord -- each of you an individual chord .
one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony .
your ears can &apos;t hear that chord ; they can actually hear amazing things . your ears can hear 10 octaves .
incidentally , we see just one octave .
your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids .
they work even when you sleep .
the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters .
the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that .
listening is an active skill , whereas hearing is passive , listening is something that we have to work at -- it &apos;s a relationship with sound .
and yet it &apos;s a skill that none of us are taught .
for example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
here are two of them .
reductive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
it reduces everything down to what &apos;s relevant and it discards everything that &apos;s not relevant .
men typically listen reductively .
so he &apos;s saying , &quot; i &apos;ve got this problem . &quot;
he &apos;s saying , &quot; here &apos;s your solution . thanks very much . next . &quot;
that &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
expansive listening , on the other hand , is listening &quot; with , &quot; not listening &quot; for . &quot;
it &apos;s got no destination in mind -- it &apos;s just enjoying the journey .
women typically listen expansively .
if you look at these two , eye contact , facing each other , possibly both talking at the same time .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time .
noise like this , according to the european union , is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of europe .
two percent of the population of europe -- that &apos;s 16 million people -- are having their sleep devastated by noise like that .
noise kills 200,000 people a year in europe .
it &apos;s a really big problem .
now , when you were little , if you had noise and you didn &apos;t want to hear it , you &apos;d stick your fingers in your ears and hum .
these days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cooler .
the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues .
the first really big health issue is a word that murray schafer coined : &quot; schizophonia . &quot;
it &apos;s a dislocation between what you see and what you hear .
so , we &apos;re inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
i think there &apos;s something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia .
the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .
we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this .
listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
and now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed .
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
there is a cost of compression .
it makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data .
you &apos;re having to imagine it .
it &apos;s not good for you in the long run .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
one study at an american university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse .
we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
i &apos;ll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children , please .
professional hearing protectors are great ; i use some all the time .
if you &apos;re going to use headphones , buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don &apos;t have to have it so loud .
and thirdly , if you &apos;re in bad sound , it &apos;s fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it .
protect your ears in that way .
wwb : wind , water , birds -- stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
seek those sounds out ; they &apos;re good for you and so it this .
silence is beautiful .
the elizabethans described language as decorated silence .
i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art .
have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion .
it &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
if you can &apos;t do it yourself , get a professional to do it for you .
sound design is the future , and i think it &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to change the way the world sounds .
i &apos;m going to just run quickly through eight modalities , eight ways sound can improve health .
first , ultrasound : we &apos;re very familiar with it from physical therapy ; it &apos;s also now being used to treat cancer .
lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
it &apos;s been around for thousands of years .
i do urge you to explore this .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
and music , of course . just listening to music is good for you , if it &apos;s music that &apos;s made with good intention , made with love , generally .
devotional music , good -- mozart , good .
there are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy .
and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved .
i hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .
it &apos;s a whole new dimension to your life and it &apos;s wonderful to have that dimension .
secondly , get in touch with making some sound -- create sound .
the voice is the instrument we all play , and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice ? get trained ; learn to sing , learn to play an instrument .
musicians have bigger brains -- it &apos;s true .
you can do this in groups as well .
it &apos;s a fantastic antidote to schizophonia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , whichever style you enjoy particularly .
and let &apos;s take a stewarding role for the sound around us .
protect your ears ? yes , absolutely .
design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work .
and let &apos;s start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that i played you early on .
so i &apos;m going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound .
my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction .
so i urge you to take that path .
i &apos;m leaving you with a little more birdsong , which is very good for you .
i wish you sound health .
julian treasure : shh ! sound health in 8 steps
julian treasure says our increasingly noisy world is gnawing away at our mental health -- even costing lives . he lays out an 8-step plan to soften this sonic assault and restore our relationship with sound .
hey guys .
it &apos;s funny , someone just mentioned macgyver , because that was , like , i loved it , and when i was seven , i taped a fork to a drill and i was like , &quot; hey , mom , i &apos;m going to olive garden . &quot;
and -- and it worked really well there .
it sounds silly , but i thought , okay , the way the world works can be changed , and it can be changed by me in these small ways .
and so , about 20 years later , i didn &apos;t realize the full effect of this , but i went to costa rica and i stayed with these guaymí natives there , and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them , and they could make beds out of trees , and they could -- i watched this woman for three days .
i was there . she was peeling this palm frond apart , these little threads off of it , and she &apos;d roll the threads together and make little thicker threads , like strings , and she would weave the strings together , and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days , the materiality of the way the world works , of reality , kind of started to unravel in my mind , because i realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener , everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to , maybe a more complicated one , but still , everything was made that way .
who &apos;s making these things ? how did they make them ?
what stops us from making them ?
so i started right away . i was at mit media lab , and i was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity .
and i started in nature , because i saw these guaymís doing it in nature , and there just seems to be less barriers .
so i went to vermont to not back to school camp , where there &apos;s unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything .
so i said , &quot; let &apos;s go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together , you know , make something , i don &apos;t care , geometrical shapes , just grab some junk from around you .
we won &apos;t bring anything with us .
and , like , within minutes , this is very easy for adults and teens to do .
here &apos;s a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream , and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together .
a leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass .
the materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it .
and after about 45 minutes , you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue , so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath .
and the creator of this , he said , &quot; this is fire . i call this fire . &quot;
and someone asked him , &quot; how do you get those sticks to stay on that tree ? &quot;
and he &apos;s like , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really amazing .
he doesn &apos;t know , but he can show you . &quot;
so his hands know and his intuition knows , but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be , especially when it comes to the human-made , human-built world .
we think we already know how something works , so we can &apos;t imagine how it could work .
we know how it &apos;s supposed to work , so we can &apos;t suppose all the things that could be possible .
i &apos;m a good hippie dad , so i &apos;m like , &quot; okay , you &apos;re going to learn to love the moon .
i &apos;m going to give you some building blocks and they &apos;re nonrectilinear cactus building blocks , so it &apos;s totally legit . &quot;
but he doesn &apos;t really know what to do with these .
i didn &apos;t show him .
and so he &apos;s like , &quot; okay , i &apos;ll just mess around with this . &quot;
this is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest .
just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff .
and before long , he &apos;s kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around , and he enlists us in helping him .
and at this point , i &apos;m starting to wonder , what kind of tools can we give people , especially adults , who know too much , so that they can see the world as malleable , so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives .
because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works , pushing what matter can do , the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium , and any sufficiently complicated task , whether you &apos;re a cook or a carpenter or you &apos;re raising a child -- anything that &apos;s complicated -- comes up with problems that aren &apos;t solved in the middle of it , and you can &apos;t do a good job getting it done unless you can say , &quot; okay , well we &apos;re just going to have to refigure this .
i don &apos;t care that pencils are supposed to be for writing .
i &apos;m going to use them a different way . &quot;
so let me show you a little demo .
this is a little piano circuit right in here , and this is an ordinary paintbrush that i smashed it together with .
and so , with some ketchup , — — and then i can kind of — — and that &apos;s awesome , right ?
but this is not what &apos;s awesome .
what &apos;s awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people .
a pencil is not just a pencil .
look what it has in the middle of it .
that &apos;s a wire running down the middle , and not only is it a wire , if you take that piano circuit , you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil , and you can lay out wire on the page , too , and get electrical current to run through it .
and so you can kind of hack a pencil , just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit .
and the electricity runs through your body too .
you can make one of these brushes just on the fly .
all you do is connect to the bristles , and the bristles are wet , so they conduct , and the person &apos;s body conducts , and leather is great to paint on , and then you can start hooking to everything , even the kitchen sink .
the metal in the sink is conductive .
flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin .
and you can even hook to the trees .
anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive , and you can use those together .
so — — i took this to those same teens , because those teens are really awesome , and they &apos;ll try things that i won &apos;t try .
i don &apos;t even have access to a facial piercing if i wanted to .
and this young woman , she made what she called a hula-looper , and as the hula hoop traveled around her body , she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there .
you can see her pointing to it in the picture .
and every time the hula hoop would smush against her body , it would connect two little pieces of copper tape , and it would make a sound , and the next sound , and it would loop the same sounds over and over again .
i ran these workshops everywhere .
in taiwan , at an art museum , this 12-year-old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue .
and professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it .
and big companies like intel or smaller design firms like ideo or startups like bump , were inviting me to give workshops , just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together .
and then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics , but let &apos;s just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over .
so this is the makey makey circuit , and i &apos;m just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you .
so i &apos;ll just plug it in , and now it &apos;s on by usb .
and i &apos;ll just hook up the forward arrow .
you guys are facing that way , so i &apos;ll hook it to this one .
and now , if i touch this piece of pizza , the slides that i showed you before should go forward .
and now if i hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow , i &apos;m kind of programming it by where i hook it up , now i have a left arrow and a right arrow , so i should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards . awesome .
because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and , like , one other guy .
so we made a video to prove that there &apos;s lots of stuff you can do .
you can kind of sketch with play-doh and just google for game controllers .
just ordinary play-doh , nothing special .
and you can literally draw joysticks and just find pacman on your computer and then just hook it up .
and you know the little plastic drawers you can get at target ?
well , if you take those out , they hold water great , but you can totally cut your toes , so yeah , just be careful .
you know the happiness project , where the experts are setting up the piano stairs , and how cool that is ?
well , i think it &apos;s cool , but we should be doing that stuff ourselves .
it shouldn &apos;t be a set of experts engineering the way the world works .
we should all be participating in changing the way the world works together .
aluminum foil . everybody has a cat .
get a bowl of water . this is just photo booth on your mac os .
hover the mouse over the &quot; take a photo &quot; button , and you &apos;ve got a little cat photo booth .
and so we needed hundreds of people to buy this .
if hundreds of people didn &apos;t buy this , we couldn &apos;t put it on the market .
and so we put it up on kickstarter , and hundreds of people bought it in the first day .
and then 30 days later , 11,000 people had backed the project .
and then what the best part is , we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it .
so this is &quot; the star-spangled banner &quot; by eating lunch , including drinking listerine .
and we actually sent this guy materials .
we &apos;re like , &quot; we &apos;re sponsoring you , man .
and dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways .
and then this brother -- look at this diagram .
see where it says &quot; sister &quot; ?
i love when people put humans on the diagram .
i always add humans to any technical -- if you &apos;re drawing a technical diagram , put a human in it .
and this kid is so sweet . he made this trampoline slideshow adventure for his sister so that on her birthday , she could be the star of the show , jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides .
and this is fun , and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun ?
but it &apos;s also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up , where people can &apos;t use computers , necessarily .
like this dad who wrote us , his son has cerebral palsy and he can &apos;t use a normal keyboard .
and so , with the makey makey , he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web .
and a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came , and we &apos;re really excited about that .
we didn &apos;t plan for that at all .
and then all these professional musicians started using it , like at coachella , just this weekend jurassic 5 was using this onstage , and this d.j. is just from brooklyn , right around here , and he put this up last month .
and i love the carrot on the turntable .
most people cannot play them that way .
and when this started to get serious , i thought , i &apos;d better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in , because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they &apos;re going to be turning into agents of creative change , and governments will be crumbling , and i wouldn &apos;t have told people , so i thought i &apos;d better warn them .
and i also put this little surprise . when you open the lid of the box , it says , &quot; the world is a construction kit . &quot;
and as you start to mess around this way , i think that , in some small ways , you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with , and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works .
and so next time you &apos;re on an escalator and you drop an m &amp; amp ; m by accident , you know , maybe that &apos;s an m &amp; amp ; m surfboard , not an escalator , so don &apos;t pick it up right away .
maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down , and maybe some chapstick , whatever .
i used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that .
but as i &apos;m kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff , i &apos;m realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can &apos;t be designed by one person or even by a million experts .
and that &apos;s the world i really want to live in .
thank you .
jay silver : hack a banana , make a keyboard !
why can &apos;t two slices of pizza be used as a slide clicker ? why shouldn &apos;t you make music with ketchup ? in this charming talk , inventor jay silver talks about the urge to play with the world around you . he shares some of his messiest inventions , and demos makey makey , a kit for hacking everyday objects .
i want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes .
the sun burns our peripheral vision .
we see light reflected off the moon .
and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies , the known universe has come to us through light , across vast eras in cosmic history .
and with all of our modern telescopes , we &apos;ve been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang .
and yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
i &apos;d like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum .
it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold .
now we &apos;d like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition .
and while we &apos;ve never heard the sounds from space , we really should , in the next few years , start to turn up the volume on what &apos;s going on out there .
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which i &apos;d like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
we can &apos;t see them directly .
they &apos;re not brought to us with light , at least not directly .
we can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
they destroy stars around them .
they churn up debris in their surroundings .
we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background , but we haven &apos;t yet .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein -- to whom we owe so much .
einstein realized that if space were empty , if the universe were empty , it would be like this picture , except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .
but if we were freely falling through the space , even without this helpful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines , undeflected straight paths through the universe .
einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe , it would curve space , and a freely falling object would pass by , let &apos;s say , the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space .
it was einstein &apos;s great general theory of relativity .
now even light will be bent by those paths .
and you can be bent so much that you &apos;re caught in orbit around the sun , as the earth is , or the moon around the earth .
these are the natural curves in space .
what einstein did not realize was that , if you took our sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe .
it wasn &apos;t einstein who realized this , it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i -- joined the german army already an accomplished scientist , working on the russian front .
i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire , and then , in between , calculating einstein &apos;s equations -- as you do in the trenches .
and he was reading einstein &apos;s recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary : curves so strong that space would rain down into them , space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole .
and even light could not escape this current .
light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a shadow .
now he wrote to einstein , and he said , &quot; as you will see , the war has been kind to me enough .
despite the heavy gunfire , i &apos;ve been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas . &quot;
and einstein was very impressed with his exact solution , and i should hope also the dedication of the scientist .
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
and he took schwarzschild &apos;s idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week .
he did not believe they existed in nature .
he thought nature would protect us from their formation .
it was decades before the term &quot; black hole &quot; was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they &apos;re the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime .
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole .
it &apos;s actually not massive enough .
but if we did a little thought experiment -- as einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers , and putting a tiny little earth around it in orbit , maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun .
and you would realize you could put the earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole .
this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan , more or less .
it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth .
we &apos;re talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan .
so we move this earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it &apos;s perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole .
there &apos;s a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in .
but what &apos;s very impressive is that , from our vantage point , we can always see the earth .
it cannot hide behind the black hole .
the light from the earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
so you can &apos;t hide anything behind a black hole .
if this were battlestar galactica and you &apos;re fighting the cylons , don &apos;t hide behind the black hole .
they can see you .
now , our sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it &apos;s not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy .
and if one were to eclipse the milky way , this is what it would look like .
we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
but even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it &apos;s not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
and even though , due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation , our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time , it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us , right before we were crushed to death by the black hole .
it would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it &apos;s a total death experience .
and there &apos;s no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together .
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the sun .
so now we &apos;re going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across .
they can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
so they &apos;re crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .
and they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
this computer simulation is due to a relativity group at nasa goddard .
it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
this was one of the groups .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
and if you can see -- it &apos;s kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out , those are the gravitational waves .
they &apos;re literally the sounds of space ringing , and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning , quiet black hole at the end of the day .
if you were standing near enough , your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space .
you would literally hear the sound .
now of course , your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully , so you might have trouble understanding what &apos;s going on .
but i &apos;d like to play for you the sound that we predict .
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
if it gets far away , it &apos;s a little too quiet .
but it comes in like a mallet , and it literally cracks space , wobbling it like a drum .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
we know that , as it falls in , it gets faster and it gets louder .
and eventually , we &apos;re going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy .
then it &apos;s gone .
now i &apos;ve never heard it that loud -- it &apos;s actually more dramatic .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
it &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
this is another sound from my group .
no , i &apos;m not showing you any images , because black holes don &apos;t leave behind helpful trails of ink , and space is not painted , showing you the curves .
but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this , you want to get moving .
want to get away from the sound .
both black holes are moving .
both black holes are getting closer together .
in this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
now it &apos;s gone .
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .
now that &apos;s our prediction for what we &apos;ll see .
luckily we &apos;re at this safe distance in long beach , california .
and surely , the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
there are very industrious experiments being built on earth -- one called ligo -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .
it &apos;s a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it &apos;s going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
and lisa will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun .
in this hubble image , we see two galaxies .
they look like they &apos;re frozen in some embrace .
and each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core .
but they &apos;re not frozen ; they &apos;re actually merging .
these two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
it &apos;s beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration .
but lisa could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe &apos;s history , the last 15 minutes before they fall together .
and it &apos;s not just black holes , but it &apos;s also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the big bang .
when that expression was coined , it was derisive -- like , &quot; oh , who would believe in a big bang ? &quot;
but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang .
it might make a sound .
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside .
we don &apos;t ever want to do that actually . we want to be inside the universe because there &apos;s no such thing as standing outside the universe .
so imagine you &apos;re inside the big bang .
it &apos;s everywhere , it &apos;s all around you , and the space is wobbling chaotically .
fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
and here we are frantically building these experiments , doing these calculations , writing these computer codes .
imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
that song has been ringing through space for all that time .
we weren &apos;t even here .
it gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
it &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
it &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we &apos;ll build them , we &apos;ll turn on the machines and , bang , we &apos;ll catch it -- the first song from space .
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up , it would sound like this .
it &apos;s a terrible sound .
it &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
it &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
but it &apos;s around us everywhere , presumably , if it hasn &apos;t been wiped out by some other process in the universe .
and if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observable universe .
so within the next few years , we &apos;ll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit , render the universe in audio .
but if we detect those earliest moments , it &apos;ll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang , which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest , most elusive , questions .
if we run the movie of our universe backwards , we know that there was a big bang in our past , and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it , but was our big bang the only big bang ?
i mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
will it happen again ?
i mean , in the spirit of rising to ted &apos;s challenge to reignite wonder , we can ask questions , at least for this last minute , that honestly might evade us forever .
but we have to ask : is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history ?
or , is it possible that we &apos;re just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own big bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without -- not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ?
here &apos;s my multiverse creatures .
are there other creatures in the multiverse , wondering about us and wondering about their own origins ?
and if they are , i can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
thank you . thank you .
janna levin : the sound the universe makes
we think of space as a silent place . but physicist janna levin says the universe has a soundtrack -- a sonic composition that records some of the most dramatic events in outer space . an accessible and mind-expanding soundwalk through the universe .
trees epitomize stasis .
trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations , but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs , trees become very dynamic entities , moving and growing .
and i decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists .
i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
the piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir , and what i learned was that different species have different signatures , like a picasso versus a monet .
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines .
i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year .
and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year .
you might have a guess .
the answer is actually 186,540 miles , or seven times around the globe .
and so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs , we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities , but rather extremely dynamic .
and i began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees , to consider other entities that are also static and stuck , but which cry for change and dynamicism , and one of those entities is our prisons .
prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
and our prison system itself is stuck .
the united states has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons , and i think the answer is yes .
in the year 2007 , i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections .
working with four prisons , we began bringing science and scientists , sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons .
we give science lectures , and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .
that , i think , is movement .
we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state .
that , i think , is movement .
we worked with the washington state department of fish and wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands .
that , i think , is movement .
and just recently , we &apos;ve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities .
they &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
they &apos;re kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day .
when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals , they &apos;re placed in immobile booths like this .
for one hour a day they &apos;re brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards .
although we can &apos;t bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments , we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards , putting them on the walls , so at least they get contact with visual images of nature .
this is mr. lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he &apos;s providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
and so what we see , i think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks .
but if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
nalini nadkarni challenges our perspective on trees and prisons -- she says both can be more dynamic than we think . through a partnership with the state of washington , she brings science classes and conservation programs to inmates , with unexpected results .
the story i wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist , as an iranian woman artist , as an iranian woman artist living in exile .
on the dark side , politics doesn &apos;t seem to escape people like me .
every iranian artist , in one form or another , is political .
politics have defined our lives .
if you &apos;re living in iran , you &apos;re facing censorship , harassment , arrest , torture -- at times , execution .
if you &apos;re living outside like me , you &apos;re faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family .
therefore , we don &apos;t find the moral , emotional , psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .
oddly enough , an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice , the speaker of my people , even if i have , indeed , no access to my own country .
also , people like myself , we &apos;re fighting two battles on different grounds .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
we are there to take pride and insist on respect .
and at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
that is our regime , our government -- our atrocious government , &#91; that &#93; has done every crime in order to stay in power .
our artists are at risk .
we are in a position of danger .
we pose a threat to the order of the government .
but ironically , this situation has empowered all of us , because we are considered , as artists , central to the cultural , political , social discourse in iran .
we are there to inspire , to provoke , to mobilize , to bring hope to our people .
we are the reporters of our people , and are communicators to the outside world .
art is our weapon .
culture is a form of resistance .
i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression .
for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics .
but also , i worry about the west , because often in this country , in this western world that we have , culture risks being a form of entertainment .
our people depend on our artists , and culture is beyond communication .
my journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place .
i did not start to make social commentary about my country .
the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separated for a good 12 years .
it was after the islamic revolution of 1979 .
while i was absent from iran , the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture .
i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society .
but instead , i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn &apos;t recognize anymore .
more so , i became very interested , as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions , i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution -- how , indeed , it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women .
i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting , in the way the women of iran , historically , seemed to embody the political transformation .
so in a way , by studying a woman , you can read the structure and the ideology of the country .
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
for me , this became incredibly important .
and yet , i had an unusual position toward this .
i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place , but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution .
this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i didn &apos;t know i would discover .
so my art became slightly more critical .
my knife became a little sharper .
and i fell into a life in exile .
i am a nomadic artist .
i work in morocco , in turkey , in mexico .
now i am making films .
last year , i finished a film called &quot; women without men . &quot;
&quot; women without men &quot; returns to history , but another part of our iranian history .
it goes to 1953 when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader , dr. mossadegh .
the book is written by an iranian woman , shahrnush parsipur .
it &apos;s a magical realist novel .
this book is banned , and she spent five years in prison .
my obsession with this book , and the reason i made this into a film , is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally , historically in iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change , freedom and democracy -- while the country of iran , equally , as if another character , also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions .
i made this film because i felt it &apos;s important for it to speak to the westerners about our history as a country .
that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution .
that iran was once a secular society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized -- in the way we looked , in the way we played music , in the way we had intellectual life .
and most of all , in the way that we fought for democracy .
these are some of the shots actually from my film .
these are some of the images of the coup .
and we made this film in casablanca , recreating all the shots .
this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story , but also a feminine story .
being a visual artist , indeed , i am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics , religion , the question of feminism , and become an important , timeless , universal work of art .
the challenge i have is how to do that .
how to tell a political story but an allegorical story .
how to move you with your emotions , but also make your mind work .
these are some of the images and the characters of the film .
what is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film , the cry for democracy and social justice , repeats itself now again in tehran .
the green movement significantly inspired the world .
it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy .
what was most significant for me was , once again , the presence of the women .
they &apos;re absolutely inspirational for me .
if in the islamic revolution , the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn &apos;t have a voice , now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran -- women who were educated , forward thinking , non-traditional , sexually open , fearless and seriously feminist .
these women and those young men united iranians across the world , inside and outside .
i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women .
that , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
they have confronted the authority .
they have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way .
and once again , they proved themselves .
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
and it &apos;s a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist , even if i have to operate in the west only for now .
thank you so much .
shirin neshat : art in exile
iranian-born artist shirin neshat explores the paradox of being an artist in exile : a voice for her people , but unable to go home . in her work , she explores iran pre- and post-islamic revolution , tracing political and societal change through powerful images of women .
a human child is born , and for quite a long time is a consumer .
it cannot be consciously a contributor .
it is helpless .
it doesn &apos;t know how to survive , even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive .
it needs the help of mother , or a foster mother , to survive .
it has to totally surrender , as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist .
it has to totally surrender .
that implies a lot of trust .
as the child grows , it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust .
it doesn &apos;t know even the word &quot; violation . &quot;
therefore , it has to blame itself , a wordless blame , which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame .
as the child grows to become an adult : so far , it has been a consumer , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute , to be a contributor .
one cannot contribute unless one feels secure , one feels big , one feels : i have enough .
to be compassionate is not a joke .
it &apos;s not that simple .
one has to discover a certain bigness in oneself .
that bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself .
the self : you are self-aware .
on that self , it should be centered -- a bigness , a wholeness .
otherwise , compassion is just a word and a dream .
you can be compassionate occasionally , more moved by empathy than by compassion .
thank god we are empathetic .
when somebody &apos;s in pain , we pick up the pain .
in a wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out .
each one has got two games .
it can be anybody &apos;s game .
what they have sweated so far has no meaning .
the tennis etiquette is , both the players have to come to the net and shake hands .
the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it .
and this guy has to come to the net .
when he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes .
it looks as though he &apos;s wishing that he didn &apos;t win .
why ? empathy .
that &apos;s human heart .
no human heart is denied of that empathy .
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
no culture , no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy .
and that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life -- even words , even time .
compassion is not defined in one form .
there &apos;s no indian compassion .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
it transcends nation , the gender , the age .
why ? because it is there in everybody .
it &apos;s experienced by people occasionally .
then this occasional compassion , we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional .
by mandate , you cannot make a person compassionate .
you can &apos;t say , &quot; please love me . &quot;
love is something you discover .
it &apos;s not an action , but in the english language , it is also an action .
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
i am going to cite the possibility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience .
and the one who is happy , even for a slapstick joke , accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself .
that means the whole universe , known things and unknown things .
all of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself .
the subject -- &quot; me &quot; -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness , an experience nobody can say , &quot; i am denied of , &quot; an experience common to all and sundry .
that experience confirms that , in spite of all your limitations -- all your wants , desires , unfulfilled , and the credit cards and layoffs and , finally , baldness -- you can be happy .
but the extension of the logic is that you don &apos;t need to fulfill your desire to be happy .
you are the very happiness , the wholeness that you want to be .
there &apos;s no choice in this : that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you , cannot be minus you .
it has got to be you .
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
your moment of happiness reveals that reality , that realization , that recognition : &quot; maybe i am the whole .
maybe the swami is right .
maybe the swami is right . &quot; you start your new life .
then everything becomes meaningful .
i have no more reason to blame myself .
if one has to blame oneself , one has a million reasons plus many .
but if i say , in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white , if it is white it is not black : body is limited any which way you look at it . limited .
your knowledge is limited , health is limited , and power is therefore limited , and the cheerfulness is going to be limited .
compassion is going to be limited .
everything is going to be limitless .
and there is no way of your being not limitless too .
your own experience reveals , in spite of all limitations , you are the whole .
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world .
it is love first .
when you relate to the world , the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is , what we say , love .
and itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion .
then that again transforms into giving , into sharing .
you express yourself because you have compassion .
to discover compassion , you need to be compassionate .
to discover the capacity to give and share , you need to be giving and sharing .
there is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming .
you learn swimming by swimming .
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
you learn cooking by cooking , having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook .
and , therefore , what i say , you have to fake it and make it .
you need to .
my predecessor meant that .
you have to act it out .
you have to act compassionately .
there is no verb for compassion , but you have an adverb for compassion .
that &apos;s interesting to me .
but then , how to act compassionately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?
you fake it and make it . this is the mantra of the united states of america .
you fake it and make it .
you act compassionately as though you have compassion : grind your teeth , take all the support system .
if you know how to pray , pray .
ask for compassion .
let me act compassionately .
do it .
you &apos;ll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion , and slowly , perhaps if you get the right teaching , you &apos;ll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself , which is oneness , wholeness , and that &apos;s what you are .
with these words , thank you very much .
dayananda saraswati : the profound journey of compassion
swami dayananda saraswati unravels the parallel paths of personal development and attaining true compassion . he walks us through each step of self-realization , from helpless infancy to the fearless act of caring for others .
the khan academy is most known for its collection of videos , so before i go any further , let me show you a little bit of a montage .
salman khan : so the hypotenuse is now going to be five .
this animal &apos;s fossils are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .
we can integrate over the surface , and the notation usually is a capital sigma .
national assembly : they create the committee of public safety , which sounds like a very nice committee .
notice , this is an aldehyde , and it &apos;s an alcohol .
start differentiating into effector and memory cells .
a galaxy . hey , there &apos;s another galaxy .
oh look , there &apos;s another galaxy .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufacturer .
sk : we now have on the order of 2,200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to vector calculus and some of the stuff you saw there .
we have a million students a month using the site , watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day .
but what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
but before i do that , i want to talk a little bit about really just how i got started .
and some of you all might know , about five years ago i was an analyst at a hedge fund , and i was in boston , and i was tutoring my cousins in new orleans , remotely .
and i started putting the first youtube videos up really just as a kind of nice-to-have , just a supplement for my cousins -- something that might give them a refresher or something .
and as soon as i put those first youtube videos up , something interesting happened -- actually a bunch of interesting things happened .
the first was the feedback from my cousins .
they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person .
and once you get over the backhanded nature of that , there was actually something very profound there .
they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin .
at first , it &apos;s very unintuitive , but when you actually think about it from their point of view , it makes a ton of sense .
you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin , without feeling like they &apos;re wasting my time .
if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago , or maybe a couple of years ago , they don &apos;t have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin .
they can just watch those videos . if they &apos;re bored , they can go ahead .
they can watch it at their own time , at their own pace .
and probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time , the very first time that you &apos;re trying to get your brain around a new concept , the very last thing you need is another human being saying , &quot; do you understand this ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before , and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room .
the other thing that happened is -- i put them on youtube just -- i saw no reason to make it private , so i let other people watch it , and then people started stumbling on it , and i started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people from around the world .
and these are just a few .
this is actually from one of the original calculus videos .
and someone wrote just on youtube -- it was a youtube comment : &quot; first time i smiled doing a derivative . &quot;
this person did a derivative and then they smiled .
and then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread .
you can go on youtube and look at these comments -- someone else wrote : &quot; same thing here .
i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day .
since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class , and here i &apos;m all like , &apos; i know kung fu . &apos; &quot; and we get a lot of feedback all along those lines .
this clearly was helping people .
but then , as the viewership kept growing and kept growing , i started getting letters from people , and it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a nice-to-have .
this is just an excerpt from one of those letters .
&quot; my 12 year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math .
we have tried everything , viewed everything , bought everything .
we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through .
then we went on to the dreaded fractions . again , he got it .
we could not believe it .
he is so excited . &quot;
and so you can imagine , here i was an analyst at a hedge fund .
it was very strange for me to do something of social value .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
and then a few other things started to dawn on me .
that , not only would it help my cousins right now , or these people who are sending letters , but that this content will never go old , that it could help their kids or their grandkids .
if isaac newton had done youtube videos on calculus , i wouldn &apos;t have to .
assuming he was good . we don &apos;t know .
the other thing that happened -- and even at this point , i said , &quot; okay , maybe it &apos;s a good supplement .
it &apos;s good for maybe home schoolers . &quot;
but i didn &apos;t think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom .
but then i started getting letters from teachers .
and the teachers would write , saying , &quot; we &apos;ve used your videos to flip the classroom .
you &apos;ve given the lectures , so now what we do ... &quot; -- and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow -- &quot; ... what i do is i assign the lectures for homework , and what used to be homework , i now have the students doing in the classroom . &quot;
and i want to pause here for -- i want to pause here for a second , because there &apos;s a couple of interesting things .
one , when those teachers are doing that , there &apos;s the obvious benefit -- the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did .
they can pause , repeat at their own pace , at their own time .
but the more interesting thing is -- and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home , and then when you go to the classroom , letting them do work , having the teacher walk around , having the peers actually be able to interact with each other , these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom .
they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- 30 kids with their fingers on their lips , not allowed to interact with each other .
a teacher , no matter how good , has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces , slightly antagonistic -- and now it &apos;s a human experience .
now they &apos;re actually interacting with each other .
so once the khan academy -- i quit my job and we turned into a real organization -- we &apos;re a not-for-profit -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ?
how do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural conclusion ?
and so what i &apos;m showing you over here , these are actual exercises that i started writing for my cousins .
the ones i started were much more primitive .
this is a more competent version of it .
but the paradigm here is , we &apos;ll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept , until you get 10 in a row .
and the khan academy videos are there .
you get hints , the actual steps for that problem , if you don &apos;t know how to do it .
but the paradigm here , it seems like a very simple thing : 10 in a row , you move on .
but it &apos;s fundamentally different than what &apos;s happening in classrooms right now .
and that exam , whether you get a 70 percent , an 80 percent , a 90 percent or a 95 percent , the class moves on to the next topic .
and even that 95 percent student , what was the five percent they didn &apos;t know ?
maybe they didn &apos;t know what happens when you raise something to the zero power .
and then you go build on that in the next concept .
that &apos;s analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle , and maybe i give you a lecture ahead of time , and i give you that bicycle for two weeks .
and then i come back after two weeks , and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s see . you &apos;re having trouble taking left turns .
you can &apos;t quite stop .
you &apos;re an 80 percent bicyclist . &quot;
so i put a big c stamp on your forehead and then i say , &quot; here &apos;s a unicycle . &quot;
but as ridiculous as that sounds , that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in our classrooms right now .
and the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden , despite being smart , despite having good teachers , and it &apos;s usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation .
so our model is learn math the way you &apos;d learn anything , like the way you would learn a bicycle .
stay on that bicycle . fall off that bicycle .
do it as long as necessary until you have mastery .
the traditional model , it penalizes you for experimentation and failure , but it does not expect mastery .
we encourage you to experiment . we encourage you to failure .
but we do expect mastery .
this is just another one of the modules .
this is trigonometry .
this is shifting and reflecting functions .
and they all fit together .
we have about 90 of these right now .
but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map .
that top node right there , that &apos;s literally single digit addition .
it &apos;s like one plus one is equal to two .
and the paradigm is , once you get 10 in a row on that , it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules .
so if you keep further down the knowledge map , we &apos;re getting into more advanced arithmetic .
further down , you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra .
further down , you start getting into algebra one , algebra two , a little bit of precalculus .
and the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be taught in this type of a framework .
so you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic , you have computer programming , you have grammar , you have genetics , all based off of that core of , if you know this and that , now you &apos;re ready for this next concept .
now that can work well for an individual learner , and i encourage , one , for you to do it with your kids , but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself .
it &apos;ll change what happens at the dinner table .
but what we want to do is to use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom and so what i &apos;m showing you here , this is actually data from a pilot in the los altos school district , where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum .
these kids aren &apos;t using textbooks , they &apos;re not getting one-size-fits-all lectures .
they &apos;re doing khan academy , they &apos;re doing that software , for roughly half of their math class .
and i want to make it clear , we don &apos;t view this as the complete math education .
what it does is -- and this is what &apos;s happening in los altos -- it frees up time .
this is the blocking and tackling , making sure you know how to move through a system of equations , and it frees up time for the simulations , for the games , for the mechanics , for the robot building , for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow .
and so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day , every kid works at their own pace -- and this is actually a live dashboard from los altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard .
every row is a student .
every column is one of those concepts .
green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
blue means they &apos;re working on it -- no need to worry .
and what the teacher does is literally just say , &quot; let me intervene on the red kids . &quot;
or even better , &quot; let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer . &quot;
now i come from a very data-centric reality , so we don &apos;t want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions : &quot; oh , what do you not understand ? &quot; or &quot; what do you do understand ? &quot;
and all of the rest .
so our paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible -- really data that , in almost any other field , is expected , if you &apos;re in finance or marketing or manufacturing -- and so the teachers can actually diagnose what &apos;s wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible .
so now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to , how long they have been spending every day , what videos have they been watching , when did they pause the videos , what did they stop watching , what exercises are they using , what have they been focused on ?
the outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on .
the inner circle shows the videos they &apos;re focused on .
and the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .
red is wrong , blue is right .
the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted .
they watched the video right over there .
and then you can see , eventually , they were able to get 10 in a row .
it &apos;s almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems .
they also got faster .
the height is how long it took them .
so when you talk about self-paced learning , it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak , differentiated learning -- but it &apos;s kind of crazy when you see it in a classroom .
because every time we &apos;ve done this , in every classroom we &apos;ve done , over and over again , if you go five days into it , there &apos;s a group of kids who &apos;ve raced ahead and there &apos;s a group of kids who are a little bit slower .
and in a traditional model , if you did a snapshot assessment , you say , &quot; these are the gifted kids , these are the slow kids .
maybe they should be tracked differently .
maybe we should put them in different classes . &quot;
but when you let every student work at their own pace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit &#91; of &#93; extra time on one concept or the other , but once they get through that concept , they just race ahead .
and it makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time .
now as valuable as something like this is in a district like los altos , our goal is to use technology to humanize , not just in los altos , but on a global scale , what &apos;s happening in education .
and actually , that kind of brings an interesting point .
a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios .
so in a traditional model , most of the teacher &apos;s time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot .
maybe five percent of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them .
now 100 percent of their time is .
so once again , using technology , not just flipping the classroom , you &apos;re humanizing the classroom , i &apos;d argue , by a factor of five or 10 .
and as valuable as that is in los altos , imagine what that does to the adult learner who &apos;s embarrassed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to college .
imagine what it does to a street kid in calcutta who has to help his family during the day , and that &apos;s the reason why he or she can &apos;t go to school .
now they can spend two hours a day and remediate , or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don &apos;t know .
now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom .
but this is all one system .
there &apos;s no reason why you can &apos;t have that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom .
imagine what happens if that student in calcutta all of a sudden can tutor your son , or your son can tutor that kid in calcutta ?
and i think what you &apos;ll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .
and that &apos;s essentially what we &apos;re trying to build .
thank you .
bill gates : i &apos;ve seen some things you &apos;re doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback -- energy points , merit badges .
tell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
sk : oh yeah . no , we have an awesome team working on it .
and i have to make it clear , it &apos;s not just me anymore .
yeah , we &apos;ve put a bunch of game mechanics in there where you get these badges , we &apos;re going to start having leader boards by area , and you get points .
it &apos;s actually been pretty interesting .
just the wording of the badging or how many points you get for doing something , we see on a system-wide basis , like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another , depending what badge you give them .
and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with los altos , how did that come about ?
sk : los altos , it was kind of crazy .
once again , i didn &apos;t expect it to be used in classrooms .
someone from their board came and said , &quot; what would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , i would just , every student work at their own pace on something like this and we &apos;d give a dashboard . &quot;
and they said , &quot; oh , this is kind of radical . we have to think about it . &quot;
and me and the rest of the team were like , &quot; they &apos;re never going to want to do this . &quot;
but literally the next day they were like , &quot; can you start in two weeks ? &quot;
so fifth grade math is where that &apos;s going on right now ?
sk : it &apos;s two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes .
i think what they &apos;re excited about is they can now follow these kids .
we &apos;ve even , on christmas , we saw some of the kids were doing it .
and we can track everything .
so they can actually track them as they go through the entire district .
through the summers , as they go from one teacher to the next , you have this continuity of data that even at the district level they can see .
so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what &apos;s going on with those kids .
so you &apos;re getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they mean ?
sk : oh yeah . most of those were specs by the teachers .
we made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves .
so we made that focus diagram .
so it &apos;s all been teacher-driven .
it &apos;s been pretty crazy .
is this ready for prime time ?
do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?
sk : yeah , it &apos;s ready .
we &apos;ve got a million people on the site already , so we can handle a few more .
no , no reason why it really can &apos;t happen in every classroom in america tomorrow .
and the vision of the tutoring thing .
the idea there is , if i &apos;m confused about a topic , somehow right in the user interface i &apos;d find people who are volunteering , maybe see their reputation , and i could schedule and connect up with those people ?
sk : absolutely . and this is something that i recommend everyone in this audience to do .
those dashboards the teachers have , you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids , or nephews , or cousins , or maybe some kids at the boys and girls club .
and yeah , you can start becoming a mentor , a tutor , really immediately .
but yeah , it &apos;s all there .
well , it &apos;s amazing .
i think you just got a glimpse of the future of education .
thank you .
salman khan : let &apos;s use video to reinvent education
salman khan talks about how and why he created the remarkable khan academy , a carefully structured series of educational videos offering complete curricula in math and , now , other subjects . he shows the power of interactive exercises , and calls for teachers to consider flipping the traditional classroom script -- give students video lectures to watch at home , and do &quot; homework &quot; in the classroom with the teacher available to help .
we see with the eyes , but we see with the brain as well .
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . we &apos;ve lived with them all our lives .
they don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
they don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
they seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
so i am going to be talking about hallucinations , and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients .
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
they told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she &apos;d gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she &apos;d had a stroke , or whether she had alzheimer &apos;s .
and so they asked me if i would come and see rosalie , the old lady .
i went in to see her .
it was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence , but she &apos;d been very startled and very bewildered , because she &apos;d been seeing things .
and she told me -- the nurses hadn &apos;t mentioned this -- that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
but now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been seeing things .
so i said , &quot; what sort of things ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; people in eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs .
a man who turns towards me and smiles .
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
animals too .
i see a white building . it &apos;s snowing , a soft snow .
i see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
then , one night , the scene changes .
i see cats and dogs walking towards me .
they come to a certain point and then stop .
then it changes again .
they wear bright colors , rose and blue , like eastern dress . &quot;
sometimes , she said , before the people come on , she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor , which seem to go up to the ceiling .
i said , &quot; is this like a dream ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; no , it &apos;s not like a dream . it &apos;s like a movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s got color . it &apos;s got motion .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
and she said that it &apos;s a rather boring movie .
she said , &quot; all these people with eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . &quot;
and she has a sense of humor .
she knew it was a hallucination .
but she was frightened . she &apos;d lived 95 years and she &apos;d never had a hallucination before .
she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear .
she had no control over them .
she said she didn &apos;t recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations .
and none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her .
and she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
well , i examined her carefully .
she was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . she had no medical problems .
she wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
but she was blind .
and i then said to her , &quot; i think i know what you have . &quot;
this was originally described , &quot; i said , &quot; right back in the 18th century , by a man called charles bonnet .
and you have charles bonnet syndrome .
there is nothing wrong with your brain . there is nothing wrong with your mind .
you have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot;
and she was very relieved at this , that there was nothing seriously the matter , and also rather curious .
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
she said , &quot; did he have them himself ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not crazy . i &apos;m not demented . i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot;
well , so i did tell the nurses .
now this , for me , is a common situation .
i work in old-age homes , largely .
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
about 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .
you don &apos;t have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired .
now with the original description in the 18th century , charles bonnet did not have them .
his grandfather had these hallucinations .
his grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
he &apos;d had cataract surgery .
his vision was pretty poor .
and in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
and he knew it was a hallucination .
you don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
and then he saw a big wheel in midair .
but sometimes he wasn &apos;t sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
so on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , &quot; and who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot;
and they said , &quot; alas , grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . &quot;
and then the handsome young men disappeared .
it &apos;s typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .
they don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
they are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
charles lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts .
on one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
that was the only figure he recognized .
on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris , he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding .
but when he got back home , he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table .
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
with him and with rosalie , what seems to be going on -- and rosalie said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot; -- and i said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable , and they start to fire spontaneously .
and you start to see things .
the things you see can be very complicated indeed .
with another patient of mine , who , also had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing .
on one occasion , she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant .
and then the six figures came together again , like a concertina .
once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads .
she had very mobile hallucinations as well .
a lot of them had to do with a car .
sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car .
he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned .
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
this was a woman who didn &apos;t have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
and , above all , she would see cartoons .
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog .
now , i don &apos;t watch sesame street , but she made a point of saying , &quot; why kermit ? &quot; she said , &quot; kermit the frog means nothing to me .
you know , i was wondering about freudian determinants .
why kermit ?
kermit the frog means nothing to me . &quot;
she didn &apos;t mind the cartoons too much .
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
and these frightened her .
well , what is going on with these people ?
as a physician , i have to try and define what &apos;s going on , and to reassure people , especially to reassure them that they &apos;re not going insane .
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visually impaired people get these .
and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed .
in particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you &apos;re going mad , but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .
psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . they accuse you .
they seduce you . they humiliate you .
they jeer at you .
you interact with them .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
there is a film . you &apos;re seeing a film which has nothing to do with you , or that &apos;s how people think about it .
there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy , and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past .
you &apos;re at a particular road junction .
you smell chestnuts roasting .
you hear the traffic . all the senses are involved .
and you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
and it &apos;s that tuesday evening back in 1982 .
and the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
the charles bonnet ones are quite different .
so in the charles bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations .
and one of the second commonest is cartoons .
so , what is going on ?
fascinatingly , in the last few years , it &apos;s been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fmri on people as they are hallucinating .
and in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating .
this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns .
you don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
when images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
and in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .
and it &apos;s known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
it &apos;s activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
it &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
there are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes .
around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
&quot; face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
so you may not only have &quot; car &quot; cells , you may have &quot; aston martin &quot; cells .
i saw an aston martin this morning .
i had to bring it in .
and now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
now , at this level , in what &apos;s called the inferotemporal cortex , there are only visual images , or figments or fragments .
it &apos;s only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion .
you &apos;re in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells .
normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
and instead of getting normal perception , you &apos;re getting an anarchic , convulsive stimulation , or release , of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex .
so , suddenly you see a face . suddenly you see a car .
suddenly this , and suddenly that .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
when these were first described , it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams .
but in fact people say , &quot; i don &apos;t recognize the people . i can &apos;t form any associations . &quot;
&quot; kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
you don &apos;t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
well , i &apos;ve more or less said what i wanted .
i think i just want to recapitulate and say this is common .
think of the number of blind people .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
finally , i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
charles bonnet said , 250 years ago -- he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain .
now , 250 years later , i think we &apos;re beginning to glimpse how this is done .
thanks very much .
that was superb . thank you so much .
you speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients .
have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
oliver sacks : i was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
well , yeah , a lot of them .
i &apos;m blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
and i see the geometrical hallucinations .
but they stop there .
and they don &apos;t disturb you ?
because you understand what &apos;s doing it , it doesn &apos;t make you worried ?
os : well they don &apos;t disturb me any more than my tinnitus , which i ignore .
they occasionally interest me , and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
i &apos;ve gone and had an fmri myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
and when i see all these hexagons and complex things , which i also have , in visual migraine , i wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
that was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
thank you so much for sharing .
os : thank you . thank you .
oliver sacks : what hallucination reveals about our minds
neurologist and author oliver sacks brings our attention to charles bonnet syndrome -- when visually impaired people experience lucid hallucinations . he describes the experiences of his patients in heartwarming detail and walks us through the biology of this under-reported phenomenon .
so i want to take you on a trip to an alien world .
and it &apos;s not a trip that requires light-years of travel , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s defined by light .
so it &apos;s a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
i &apos;ve spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .
i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs .
i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .
but mostly i &apos;m entranced by it .
since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible , when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays , i &apos;ve been a bioluminescence junky .
i needed some way to share the experience directly .
and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called deep rover .
this next video clip , you &apos;re going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence .
and the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
in front of the sub , a mess screen will come into contact with the sub &apos;s lights switched off , it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh .
this is the first time it has ever been recorded .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible .
but just to try to prove that fact to you , i &apos;ve brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration .
so , if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible , i have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it .
and you &apos;ll note there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , either because they &apos;re dead -- or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like .
oops . sorry .
i spend most of my time working in the dark ; i &apos;m used to that .
okay .
so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate , a single-celled alga .
so why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ?
well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
the flash is like a scream for help .
it &apos;s what &apos;s known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm , and just like the alarm on your car or your house , it &apos;s meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder , thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .
it &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
so we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime , because the top speed of this fish is one knot , which was the top speed of the submersible .
but it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
the light organs under the eyes are flashing .
that chin barbel is flashing .
it &apos;s got light organs on its belly that are flashing , fin lights .
it &apos;s phenomenal .
and you normally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets .
there &apos;s other ways you can defend yourself with light .
for example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
this blinds or distracts the predator .
this little squid is called the fire shooter now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig &apos;s head with wings -- but if it &apos;s attacked , it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes .
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
it &apos;s phenomenal .
so there &apos;s a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light .
they use it for finding food , for attracting mates , for defending against predators .
but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean , that &apos;s where things get really strange .
and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in &quot; avatar , &quot; but you don &apos;t have to travel to pandora to see them .
they &apos;re things like this .
this is a golden coral , a bush .
it grows very slowly .
in fact , it &apos;s thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old , which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed .
the other reason is this amazing bush glows .
so if you brush up against it , any place you brushed against it , you get this twinkling blue-green light that &apos;s just breathtaking .
and you see things like this .
and these are flytrap anemones .
now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
but if you keep poking it , it starts to produce light .
and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
there are starfish that can make light .
and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
and it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock .
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
but if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue .
colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
but we have no idea why it does that .
it &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
it &apos;s a green saber of light .
and like the one you just saw , it can produce these as bands of light .
so if i squeeze the base , the bands go from base to tip .
if i squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base .
so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle ?
i &apos;d be very interested in your theories about what that &apos;s about .
so there &apos;s a language of light in the deep ocean , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re imitating a lot of these displays .
we call it the electronic jellyfish .
it &apos;s just 16 blue leds that we can program to do different types of displays .
so i just want to show you some of the responses we &apos;ve elicited from animals in the deep sea .
so the camera &apos;s black and white .
it &apos;s not high-resolution .
and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
and when it starts flashing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the leds that &apos;s flashing very fast .
but as soon as it starts to flash -- and it &apos;s going to look big , because it blooms on the camera -- i want you to look right here .
there &apos;s something small there that responds .
we &apos;re talking to something .
it looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact , three strings of pearls .
and this was very consistent .
this was in the bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
we basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking .
and i think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
but the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it .
we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
personally , i think it &apos;s something sexy .
and then finally , i want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world &apos;s first deep-sea webcam , which we had installed in monterey canyon last year .
we &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
and it is an optical cue that there &apos;s carrion on the bottom of the ocean .
so this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark .
and i can &apos;t claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there &apos;s bait right there .
but if it had been following the odor plume , it would have come in from the other direction .
that &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
okay , so this next one is from the webcam , and it &apos;s going to be this pinwheel display .
and this is a burglar alarm .
and that was a humboldt squid , a juvenile humboldt squid , about three feet long .
this is at 3,000 feet in monterey canyon .
but if it &apos;s a burglar alarm , you wouldn &apos;t expect it to attack the jellyfish directly .
it &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
this guy is a little more contemplative .
&quot; hey , wait a minute .
there &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
he &apos;s thinking about it .
but he &apos;s persistent .
he keeps coming back .
and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more , and thinks , &quot; maybe if i come in from a different angle . &quot;
so we are starting to get a handle on this , but only just the beginnings .
so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible , by all means , climb in and take the plunge .
this is something that should be on everybody &apos;s bucket list , because we live on an ocean planet .
more than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean .
it &apos;s a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures , alien life forms that you don &apos;t have to travel to another planet to see .
but if you do take the plunge , please remember to turn out the lights .
but i warn you , it &apos;s addictive .
thank you .
in the deep , dark ocean , many sea creatures make their own light for hunting , mating and self-defense . bioluminescence expert edith widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world . at ted2011 , she brings some of her glowing friends onstage , and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life .
what i &apos;m going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body .
now molecules are really , really tiny .
and by tiny , i mean really .
they &apos;re smaller than a wavelength of light , so we have no way to directly observe them .
but through science , we do have a fairly good idea of what &apos;s going on down at the molecular scale .
so what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules , but we don &apos;t really have a direct way of showing you the molecules .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
and this idea is actually nothing new .
scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .
they draw pictures of what they &apos;re observing with their eyes , through technology like telescopes and microscopes , and also what they &apos;re thinking about in their minds .
i picked two well-known examples , because they &apos;re very well-known for expressing science through art .
and i start with galileo who used the world &apos;s first telescope to look at the moon .
and he transformed our understanding of the moon .
the perception in the 17th century was the moon was a perfect heavenly sphere .
but what galileo saw was a rocky , barren world , which he expressed through his watercolor painting .
another scientist with very big ideas , the superstar of biology , is charles darwin .
and with this famous entry in his notebook , he begins in the top left-hand corner with , &quot; i think , &quot; and then sketches out the first tree of life , which is his perception of how all the species , all living things on earth , are connected through evolutionary history -- the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population .
even as a scientist , i used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible , with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work , until i encountered the artworks of david goodsell , who is a molecular biologist at the scripps institute .
and his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like .
so this is a transection through blood .
in the top left-hand corner , you &apos;ve got this yellow-green area .
and the red region is a slice into a red blood cell .
and those red molecules are hemoglobin .
they are actually red ; that &apos;s what gives blood its color .
and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body .
i was very much inspired by this image many years ago , and i wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world .
what would it look like ?
and that &apos;s how i really began . so let &apos;s begin .
this is dna in its classic double helix form .
and it &apos;s from x-ray crystallography , so it &apos;s an accurate model of dna .
if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
those are the letters of genetic code , the 25,000 genes you &apos;ve got written in your dna .
this is what they typically talk about -- the genetic code -- this is what they &apos;re talking about .
but i want to talk about a different aspect of dna science , and that is the physical nature of dna .
it &apos;s these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons i can &apos;t go into right now .
but they physically run in opposite directions , which creates a number of complications for your living cells , as you &apos;re about to see , most particularly when dna is being copied .
and so what i &apos;m about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that &apos;s occurring right now inside your body , at least 2002 biology .
so dna &apos;s entering the production line from the left-hand side , and it hits this collection , these miniature biochemical machines , that are pulling apart the dna strand and making an exact copy .
so dna comes in and hits this blue , doughnut-shaped structure and it &apos;s ripped apart into its two strands .
one strand can be copied directly , and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there .
but things aren &apos;t so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards .
so it &apos;s thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time , creating two new dna molecules .
now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you , copying your dna with exquisite fidelity .
i &apos;ve left out error correction and a bunch of other things .
this was work from a number of years ago .
thank you .
this is work from a number of years ago , but what i &apos;ll show you next is updated science , it &apos;s updated technology .
so again , we begin with dna .
and it &apos;s jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules , which i &apos;ve stripped away so you can see something .
dna is about two nanometers across , which is really quite tiny .
but in each one of your cells , each strand of dna is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .
so to keep the dna organized and regulate access to the genetic code , it &apos;s wrapped around these purple proteins -- or i &apos;ve labeled them purple here .
it &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
all this field of view is a single strand of dna .
this huge package of dna is called a chromosome .
we &apos;re pulling out , we &apos;re zooming out , out through a nuclear pore , which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the dna called the nucleus .
all of this field of view is about a semester &apos;s worth of biology , and i &apos;ve got seven minutes .
so we &apos;re not going to be able to do that today ?
no , i &apos;m being told , &quot; no . &quot;
this is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope .
and it &apos;s been filmed under time-lapse , which is why you can see it moving .
the nuclear envelope breaks down .
these sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes , and we &apos;ll focus on them .
they go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots .
when the cell feels it &apos;s ready to go , it rips apart the chromosome .
and then the cell splits down the middle .
and again , you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you .
now we &apos;re going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it .
so again , here we are at that equator moment .
the chromosomes line up .
and if we isolate just one chromosome , we &apos;re going to pull it out and have a look at its structure .
so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have , at least as far as we &apos;ve discovered so far inside of us .
so this is a single chromosome .
and you have two strands of dna in each chromosome .
one is bundled up into one sausage .
these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell .
they &apos;re called mircrotubules . that name &apos;s not important .
but what we &apos;re going to focus on is this red region -- i &apos;ve labeled it red here -- and it &apos;s the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes .
it is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes .
we have no idea really as to how it &apos;s achieving that movement .
we &apos;ve been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study , and we &apos;re still just beginning to discover what it &apos;s all about .
it is made up of about 200 different types of proteins , thousands of proteins in total .
it is a signal broadcasting system .
it broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it &apos;s ready , when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes .
it is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules .
it &apos;s involved with the growing of the microtubules , and it &apos;s able to transiently couple onto them .
it &apos;s also an attention sensing system .
it &apos;s turning green here because it feels that everything is just right .
and you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s this one little last bit that &apos;s still remaining red .
and it &apos;s walked away down the microtubules .
and it &apos;s walked away . i mean , it &apos;s that mechanical .
it &apos;s molecular clockwork .
this is how you work at the molecular scale .
they &apos;re little molecular courier molecules walking one way .
and here are the dynein . they &apos;re carrying that broadcasting system .
and they &apos;ve got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on .
so again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
the problem is we can &apos;t show it to you any other way .
exploring at the frontier of science , at the frontier of human understanding , is mind-blowing .
discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science .
but most medical researchers -- discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals , which are to eradicate disease , to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty .
thank you .
drew berry : animations of unseeable biology
we have no ways to directly observe molecules and what they do -- drew berry wants to change that . in this talk , he shows his scientifically accurate animations that help researchers see unseeable processes within our own cells . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
what i &apos;m going to do is to just give a few notes , and this is from a book i &apos;m preparing called &quot; letters to a young scientist . &quot;
i &apos;d thought it &apos;d be appropriate to present it , on the basis that i have had extensive experience in teaching , counseling scientists across a broad array of fields .
and you might like to hear some of the principles that i &apos;ve developed in doing that teaching and counseling .
so let me begin by urging you , particularly you on the youngsters &apos; side , on this path you &apos;ve chosen , to go as far as you can .
the world needs you , badly .
there is going to be no turning back .
although varying among disciplines -- say , astrophysics , molecular genetics , the immunology , the microbiology , the public health , to the new area of the human body as a symbiont , to public health , environmental science .
knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every 15 to 20 years .
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
between them , the two already pervade , as most of you here seated realize , every dimension of human life .
so swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution , so startling in its countless twists and turns , that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment .
there will come a time , of course , when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge , which actually began in the 1600s , has to peak and level off , the revolution is going to continue for at least several more decades .
it &apos;ll render the human condition radically different from what it is today .
in time , all of science will come to be a continuum of description , an explanation of networks , of principles and laws .
that &apos;s why you need not just be training in one specialty , but also acquire breadth in other fields , related to and even distant from your own initial choice .
keep your eyes lifted and your head turning .
the search for knowledge is in our genes .
it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world , and it &apos;s never going to be quenched .
to understand and use it sanely , as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you .
in education , medicine , law , diplomacy , government , business and the media that exist today .
our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy , which most badly lack today -- no applause , please .
it will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job .
therefore you will do well to act on the side , no matter how far into the laboratory you may go , to serve as teachers during the span of your career .
i &apos;ll now proceed quickly , and before else , to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career .
if you are a bit short in mathematical skills , don &apos;t worry .
many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-literate .
a metaphor will serve here : where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , some may have considered me foolhardy , but it &apos;s been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists .
these math-phobes deprive science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent .
here &apos;s how to relax your anxieties , if you have them : understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages , or like verbal language generally , by its own grammar and system of logic .
any person with average quantitative intelligence who learns to read and write mathematics at an elementary level will , as in verbal language , have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science .
the longer you wait to become at least semi-literate the harder the language of mathematics will be to master , just as again in any verbal language , but it can be done at any age .
i speak as an authority on that subject , because i &apos;m an extreme case .
i didn &apos;t take algebra until my freshman year at the university of alabama .
they didn &apos;t teach it before then .
i finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at harvard , where i sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students , little more than half my age .
a couple of them were students in a course i was giving on evolutionary biology .
i swallowed my pride , and i learned calculus .
i found out that in science and all its applications , what is crucial is not that technical ability , but it is imagination in all of its applications .
the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition .
i found out that advances in science rarely come upstream from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations .
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied of foremost importance is a thorough , well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter .
when something new is discovered , it &apos;s logical then that one of the follow-up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward .
if that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery , a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator .
consider the following principle , which i will modestly call wilson &apos;s principle number one : it is far easier for scientists including medical researchers , to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations .
it is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply , and focus on that .
keep in mind , then , wilson &apos;s second principle : for every scientist , whether researcher , technician , teacher , manager or businessman , working at any level of mathematical competence , there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence .
now i &apos;m going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career , or if you &apos;re teaching , how you might enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists .
in selecting a subject in which to conduct original research , or to develop world-class expertise , take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited .
this is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement of broad training , or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality .
it is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful programs , and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support .
but through it all , look for a way to break out , to find a field and subject not yet popular .
we have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine .
there is the quickest way advances are likely to occur , as measured in discoveries per investigator per year .
you may have heard the military dictum for the gathering of armies : march to the sound of the guns .
in science , the exact opposite is the case : march away from the sound of the guns .
so wilson &apos;s principle number three : march away from the sound of the guns .
observe from a distance , but do not join the fray .
make a fray of your own .
once you have settled on a specialty , and the profession you can love , and you &apos;ve secured opportunity , your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert .
there are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine .
and on then into the social sciences , where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority .
when the subject is still very thinly populated , you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority .
the world needs this kind of expertise , and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it .
the existing information and what you self-discover may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge .
well , if that &apos;s the case , good . why hard instead of easy ?
the answer deserves to be stated as principle number four .
in the attempt to make scientific discoveries , every problem is an opportunity , and the more difficult the problem , the greater will be the importance of its solution .
now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made .
scientists , pure mathematicians among them , follow one or the other of two pathways : first through early discoveries , a problem is identified and a solution is sought .
the problem may be relatively small ; for example , where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread ?
as the answer is sought , other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked .
this first of the two strategies is like a hunter , exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry , who finds other quarries along the way .
the second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call &quot; the naturalist &apos;s trance , &quot; the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting , any quarry worth taking .
the search is not for the solution of the problem , but for problems themselves worth solving .
the two strategies of research , original research , can be stated as follows , in the final principle i &apos;m going to offer you : for every problem in a given discipline of science , there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution .
and conversely , for every species or other entity or phenomenon , there exist important problems for the solution of which , those particular objects of research are ideally suited .
find out what they are .
you &apos;ll find your own way to discover , to learn , to teach .
the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention , general health , the quality of life .
all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master .
you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction , at its conclusion , of a life well lived .
and i thank you for having me here tonight .
oh , thank you .
e.o. wilson : advice to young scientists
&quot; the world needs you , badly , &quot; begins celebrated biologist e.o. wilson in his letter to a young scientist . previewing his upcoming book , he gives advice collected from a lifetime of experience -- reminding us that wonder and creativity are the center of the scientific life . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i &apos;m here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done .
here is the old story -- we &apos;ve already heard a little bit about it : biology is war in which only the fiercest survive ; businesses and nations succeed only by defeating , destroying and dominating competition ; politics is about your side winning at all costs .
but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge .
it &apos;s a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines , in which cooperation , collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role .
and the central , but not all-important , role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room .
i started thinking about the relationship between communication , media and collective action when i wrote &quot; smart mobs , &quot; and i found that when i finished the book , i kept thinking about it .
in fact , if you look back , human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time .
the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive .
but at some point , they banded together to hunt bigger game .
and we don &apos;t know exactly how they did this , although they must have solved some collective action problems ; it only makes sense that you can &apos;t hunt mastodons while you &apos;re fighting with the other groups .
and again , we have no way of knowing , but it &apos;s clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged .
more protein than a hunter &apos;s family could eat before it rotted .
so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms .
did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families ?
and if so , how did they make arrangements ?
again , we can &apos;t know , but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .
of course , with agriculture came the first big civilizations , the first cities built of mud and brick , the first empires .
and it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks ; marks on clay in that time .
not too much longer after that , the alphabet was invented .
and this powerful tool was really reserved , for thousands of years , for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires .
and then another communication technology enabled new media : the printing press came along , and within decades , millions of people became literate .
and from literate populations , new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge , religion and politics .
we saw scientific revolutions , the protestant reformation , constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .
not created by the printing press , but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy .
and again , new forms of wealth emerged .
now , commerce is ancient . markets are as old as the crossroads .
but capitalism , as we know it , is only a few hundred years old , enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies , such as the joint-stock ownership company , shared liability insurance , double-entry bookkeeping .
now of course , the enabling technologies are based on the internet , and in the many-to-many era , every desktop is now a printing press , a broadcasting station , a community or a marketplace .
evolution is speeding up .
now , when i started looking into collective action , the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call &quot; social dilemmas . &quot;
and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas .
i &apos;m going to talk briefly about two of them : the prisoner &apos;s dilemma and the tragedy of the commons .
now , when i talked about this with kevin kelly , he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner &apos;s dilemma , so i &apos;m just going to go over that very , very quickly .
if you have more questions about it , ask kevin kelly later .
the prisoner &apos;s dilemma is actually a story that &apos;s overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war : two players who couldn &apos;t trust each other .
let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner &apos;s dilemma .
person with the goods , person with the money , because they can &apos;t trust each other , are not going to exchange .
neither one wants to be the first one or they &apos;re going to get the sucker &apos;s payoff , but both lose , of course , because they don &apos;t get what they want .
if they could only agree , if they could only turn a prisoner &apos;s dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game , they could proceed .
twenty years ago , robert axelrod used the prisoner &apos;s dilemma as a probe of the biological question : if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors , how does cooperation exist at all ?
he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner &apos;s dilemma strategies and discovered , much to his surprise , that a very , very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament , and even after everyone knew it won , it won the second tournament -- that &apos;s known as tit for tat .
another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner &apos;s dilemma is the ultimatum game , and it &apos;s also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions .
here &apos;s how the game is played : there are two players ; they &apos;ve never played the game before , they will not play the game again , they don &apos;t know each other , and they are , in fact , in separate rooms .
first player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split : 50 / 50 , 90 / 10 , whatever that player wants to propose . the second player either accepts the split -- both players are paid and the game is over -- or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over .
now , the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it &apos;s irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don &apos;t know in another room is going to get 99 .
yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students , a significant percentage would reject any offer that &apos;s not close to 50 / 50 .
and although they were screened and didn &apos;t know about the game and had never played the game before , proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50 / 50 .
now , the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered , to their surprise , that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures -- each had radically different ideas of what is fair .
which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness , that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions , whether we know that or not .
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s .
he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it .
now , elinor ostrom , a political scientist , in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask , which is : is it really true that humans will always despoil commons ?
so she went out and looked at what data she could find .
she looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds , forestry resources , fisheries , and discovered that yes , in case after case , humans destroyed the commons that they depended on .
but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner &apos;s dilemma ; in fact , the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner &apos;s dilemma .
and she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be .
they escape by creating institutions for collective action .
and she discovered , i think most interestingly , that among those institutions that worked , there were a number of common design principles , and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don &apos;t work .
i &apos;m moving very quickly over a number of disciplines . in biology , the notions of symbiosis , group selection , evolutionary psychology are contested , to be sure .
but there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology , from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology .
and again , our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned .
rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor .
in fact , people will act to punish cheaters , even at a cost to themselves .
and most recently , neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .
which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together .
now , i &apos;ve been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms .
commerce is ancient . markets are very old . capitalism is fairly recent ; socialism emerged as a reaction to that .
and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging .
jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler &apos;s paper about open source , pointing to a new form of production : peer-to-peer production .
i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past , new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth , we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones .
very briefly , let &apos;s look at some businesses . ibm , as you know , hp , sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing their software , are providing portfolios of patents for the commons .
eli lilly -- in , again , the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems .
now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism ; they &apos;re doing it because they &apos;re learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest .
open source production has shown us that world-class software , like linux and mozilla , can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we &apos;ve known them .
google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense .
amazon has opened its application programming interface to 60,000 developers , countless amazon shops .
they &apos;re enriching others , not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves .
ebay solved the prisoner &apos;s dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner &apos;s dilemma game into an assurance game .
instead of , &quot; neither of us can trust each other , so we have to make suboptimal moves , &quot; it &apos;s , &quot; you prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate . &quot;
wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years .
we &apos;ve seen that thinkcycle has enabled ngos in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world , including something that &apos;s being used for tsunami relief right now : it &apos;s a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that &apos;s so simple to use it , illiterates can be trained to use it .
millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they &apos;re not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that &apos;s folding @ home at stanford -- to crack codes , to search for life in outer space .
i don &apos;t think we know enough yet .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve even begun to discover what the basic principles are , but i think we can begin to think about them .
and i don &apos;t have enough time to talk about all of them , but think about self-interest .
in el salvador , both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner &apos;s dilemma strategy .
in the u.s. , in the philippines , in kenya , around the world , citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms .
is an apollo project of cooperation possible ?
a transdisciplinary study of cooperation ?
i believe that the payoff would be very big .
i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines .
and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people -- and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things -- but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago , people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits .
descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking .
when the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease , suffering was alleviated .
i don &apos;t think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen ; it &apos;s going to require effort .
so i enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started .
thank you .
howard rheingold talks about the coming world of collaboration , participatory media and collective action -- and how wikipedia is really an outgrowth of our natural human instinct to work as a group .
about a year and a half ago , stephen lawler , who also gave a talk here at ted in 2007 on virtual earth , brought me over to become the architect of bing maps , which is microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
in the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
so , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
so , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
this can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3d structure of the city , all the facades .
now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
if you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
so , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in haiti , before and after pictures from the sky .
this wonderful one which i don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
it &apos;s wonderful .
but i &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
so , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
these little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
i &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
and so , when you fly down -- thank you . when you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if i click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3d understanding behind this model .
this takes flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so -- i &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one i actually meant to pull up , but -- but notice -- this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
so this one was taken around five .
so that &apos;s the flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
so you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
thank you .
and i &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
but what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that i &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
now i just made a transition indoors . that &apos;s also interesting .
ok , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
we &apos;re inside the pike place market .
and this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
and from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
so this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
ok .
all right , guys , are you there ?
all right . i &apos;m hitting it . i &apos;m punching play .
i &apos;m live . all right . there we go .
so , these are our friends in pike place market , the lab .
so they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
ok , george , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
because i want to show points of interest .
no , no . the other way .
i don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
ok , ok , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
ok , never mind .
what i wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
what the hell are you guys -- oh , sorry .
we &apos;re doing two different -- ok , i &apos;m hanging up now .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
all right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
i &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
and while i walk outside , i &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
when you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
so here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
that was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4g network from the market .
all right , and now there &apos;s one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years .
and that &apos;s curtis wong , worldwide telescope .
so , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
this is the integration of worldwide telescope into our maps .
this is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time . if we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
so , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the earth .
all right now , i &apos;ve overrun my time , so i &apos;ve got to stop .
thank you all very much .
in a demo that drew gasps at ted2010 , blaise aguera y arcas demos new augmented-reality mapping technology from microsoft .
i want to talk a little bit today about labor and work .
when we think about how people work , the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze -- that all people care about is money , and the moment we give people money , we can direct them to work one way , we can direct them to work another way .
this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
and we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like .
think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing .
if you read books of people who climb mountains , difficult mountains , do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness ?
no , they are full of misery .
in fact , it &apos;s all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold , challenging circumstances .
and if people were just trying to be happy , the moment they would get to the top , they would say , &quot; this was a terrible mistake .
i &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
&quot; instead , let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos . &quot;
but instead , people go down , and after they recover , they go up again .
and if you think about mountain climbing as an example , it suggests all kinds of things .
it suggests that we care about reaching the end , a peak .
it suggests that we care about the fight , about the challenge .
it suggests that there &apos;s all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways .
and for me personally , i started thinking about this after a student came to visit me .
this was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier .
and he came one day back to campus .
and he told me the following story : he said that for more than two weeks , he was working on a powerpoint presentation .
he was working in a big bank .
and he was working very hard on this presentation -- graphs , tables , information .
he stayed late at night every day .
and the day before it was due , he sent his powerpoint presentation to his boss , and his boss wrote him back and said , &quot; nice presentation , but the merger is canceled . &quot;
and the guy was deeply depressed .
now at the moment when he was working , he was actually quite happy .
every night he was enjoying his work , he was staying late , he was perfecting this powerpoint presentation .
but knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed .
so i started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor .
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos , and we asked them to build with legos .
and for some people , we gave them legos and we said , &quot; hey , would you like to build this bionicle for three dollars ?
we &apos;ll pay you three dollars for it . &quot;
and people said yes , and they built with these legos .
and when they finished , we took it , we put it under the table , and we said , &quot; would you like to build another one , this time for $ 2.70 ? &quot;
if they said yes , we gave them another one .
and when they finished , we asked them , &quot; do you want to build another one ? &quot; for $ 2.40 , $ 2.10 , and so on , until at some point people said , &quot; no more . it &apos;s not worth it for me . &quot;
this was what we called the meaningful condition .
people built one bionicle after another .
after they finished every one of them , we put them under the table .
and we told them that at the end of the experiment , we will take all these bionicles , we will disassemble them , we will put them back in the boxes , and we will use it for the next participant .
there was another condition .
this other condition was inspired by david , my student .
and this other condition we called the sisyphic condition .
and you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work .
you can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills , at least he would have some sense of progress .
also , if you look at prison movies , sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole and when the prisoner is finished , they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again .
there &apos;s something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating .
so in the second condition of this experiment , that &apos;s exactly what we did .
we asked people , &quot; would you like to build one bionicle for three dollars ? &quot;
and if they said yes , they built it .
then we asked them , &quot; do you want to build another one for $ 2.70 ? &quot;
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
and when they finished that , we said , &quot; would you like to build another one , this time for 30 cents less ? &quot;
and if they said yes , we gave them the one that they built and we broke .
so this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes .
now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
the first thing that happened was that people built many more bionicles -- they built 11 versus seven -- in the meaningful condition versus the sisyphus condition .
and by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
people were not curing cancer or building bridges .
people were building bionicles for a few cents .
and not only that , everybody knew that the bionicles would be destroyed quite soon .
so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
but even the small meaning made a difference .
now we had another version of this experiment .
in this other version of the experiment , we didn &apos;t put people in this situation , we just described to them the situation , much as i am describing to you now , and we asked them to predict what the result would be .
people predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude .
people who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more bionicle .
so people understand that meaning is important , they just don &apos;t understand the magnitude of the importance , the extent to which it &apos;s important .
there was one other piece of data we looked at .
if you think about it , there are some people who love legos and some people who don &apos;t .
and you would speculate that the people who love legos will build more legos , even for less money , because after all , they get more internal joy from it .
and the people who love legos less will build less legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower .
and that &apos;s actually what we found in the meaningful condition .
there was a very nice correlation between love of lego and the amount of legos people built .
what happened in the sisyphic condition ?
in that condition the correlation was zero .
there was no relationship between the love of lego and how much people built , which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people &apos;s eyes , we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity .
we basically eliminated it .
soon after i finished running this experiment , i went to talk to a big software company in seattle .
i can &apos;t tell you who they were , but they were a big company in seattle .
and this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building .
and they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company .
and the week before i showed up , the ceo of this big software company went to that group , 200 engineers , and canceled the project .
and i stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people i &apos;ve ever talked to .
and i described to them some of these lego experiments , and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment .
and i asked them , i said , &quot; how many of you now show up to work later than you used to ? &quot;
and everybody raised their hand .
and everybody raised their hand .
i asked them , &quot; how many of you now add not-so-kosher things to your expense reports ? &quot;
and they didn &apos;t really raise their hands , but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports .
and then i asked them , i said , &quot; what could the ceo have done to make you not as depressed ? &quot;
and they came up with all kinds of ideas .
they said the ceo could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do .
he could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization .
he could have asked them to build some prototypes , some next-generation prototypes , and seen how they would work .
but the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation .
and i think the ceo basically did not understand the importance of meaning .
if the ceo , just like our participants , thought the essence of meaning is unimportant , then he &#91; wouldn &apos;t &#93; care .
and he would tell them , &quot; at the moment i directed you in this way , and now that i am directing you in this way , everything will be okay . &quot;
but if you understood how important meaning is , then you would figure out that it &apos;s actually important to spend some time , energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they &apos;re doing .
the next experiment was slightly different .
that was the task .
and people did the first sheet .
and then we asked them if they wanted to do the next sheet for a little bit less money and the next sheet for a little bit less money , and so on and so forth .
and we had three conditions .
in the first condition , people wrote their name on the sheet , found all the pairs of letters , gave it to the experimenter .
the experimenter would look at it , scan it from top to bottom , say &quot; uh huh &quot; and put it on the pile next to them .
in the second condition , people did not write their name on it .
the experimenter looked at it , took the sheet of paper , did not look at it , did not scan it , and simply put it on the pile of pages .
and in the third condition , the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder .
what happened in those three conditions ?
in this plot i &apos;m showing you at what pay rate people stopped .
so low numbers mean that people worked harder . they worked for much longer .
in the acknowledged condition , people worked all the way down to 15 cents .
at 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these efforts .
in the shredder condition , it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet .
and this is basically the result we had before .
you shred people &apos;s efforts , output , you get them not to be as happy with what they &apos;re doing .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could have cheated .
they could have done not so good work , because they realized that people were just shredding it .
so maybe the first sheet you would do good work , but then you see nobody is really testing it , so you would do more and more and more .
so in fact , in the shredder condition , people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it .
would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder , or somewhere in the middle ?
it turns out it was almost like the shredder .
now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
the bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes .
ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done , scanning it and saying &quot; uh huh , &quot; that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people &apos;s motivations .
so the good news is that adding motivation doesn &apos;t seem to be so difficult .
the bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy , and if we don &apos;t think about it carefully , we might overdo it .
so this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation .
so there is a store in the u.s. called ikea .
and ikea is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble .
and i don &apos;t know about you , but every time i assemble one of those , it takes me much longer , it &apos;s much more effortful , it &apos;s much more confusing .
i put things in the wrong way .
i can &apos;t say enjoy those pieces .
i can &apos;t say i enjoy the process .
but when i finish it , i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones .
and there &apos;s an old story about cake mixes .
so when they started cake mixes in the &apos; 40s , they would take this powder and they would put it in a box , and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in , stir some water in it , mix it , put it in the oven , and -- voila ! -- you had cake .
but it turns out they were very unpopular .
people did not want them .
and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
maybe the taste was not good .
no , the taste was great .
what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
it was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say , &quot; here is my cake . &quot;
no , no , no , it was somebody else &apos;s cake .
it was as if you bought it in the store .
it didn &apos;t really feel like your own .
so what did they do ?
they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
now you had to break the eggs and add them .
now it was your cake . now everything was fine .
now i think a little bit like the ikea effect , by getting people to work harder , they actually got them to love what they &apos;re doing to a higher degree .
so how do we look at this question experimentally ?
we asked people to build some origami .
we gave them instructions on how to create origami , and we gave them a sheet of paper .
and these were all novices , and they built something that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane .
but then we told them , we said , &quot; look , this origami really belongs to us .
you worked for us , but i &apos;ll tell you what , we &apos;ll sell it to you .
how much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
and we measured how much they were willing to pay for it .
and we had two types of people .
we had the people who built it , and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers .
and what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami , and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally .
now you could say , if you were a builder , do you think that , &quot; oh , i love this origami , but i know that nobody else would love it ? &quot;
or do you think , &quot; i love this origami , and everybody else will love it as well ? &quot;
which one of those two is correct ?
turns out the builders not only loved the origami more , they thought that everybody would see the world in their view .
they thought everybody else would love it more as well .
in the next version we tried to do the ikea effect .
we tried to make it more difficult .
so for some people we gave the same task .
for some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
for some people we just eliminated that .
so now this was tougher . what happened ?
well in an objective way , the origami now was uglier , it was more difficult .
now when we looked at the easy origami , we saw the same thing : builders loved it more , evaluators loved it less .
when you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
why ? because now the builders loved it even more .
they put all this extra effort into it .
and evaluators ? they loved it even less .
because in reality it was even uglier than the first version .
of course , this tells you something about how we evaluate things .
now think about kids .
imagine i asked you , &quot; how much would you sell your kids for ? &quot;
your memories and associations and so on .
most people would say for a lot , a lot of money -- on good days .
imagine if you did not have your kids , and one day you went to the park and you met some kids , and they were just like your kids .
and you played with them for a few hours .
and when you were about to leave , the parents said , &quot; hey , by the way , just before you leave , if you &apos;re interested , they &apos;re for sale . &quot;
how much would you pay for them now ?
most people say not that much .
and this is because our kids are so valuable , not just because of who they are , but because of us , because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection .
and by the way , if you think that ikea instructions are not good , think about the instructions that come with kids .
those are really tough .
which comes to tell you one more thing , which is , much like our builders , when they look at the creature of their creation , we don &apos;t see that other people don &apos;t see things our way .
let me say one last comment .
if you think about adam smith versus karl marx , adam smith had the very important notion of efficiency .
he gave an example of a pin factory .
he said pins have 12 different steps , and if one person does all 12 steps , production is very low .
but if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on , production can increase tremendously .
and indeed , this is a great example and the reason for the industrial revolution and efficiency .
karl marx , on the other hand , said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing .
and if you make all 12 steps , you care about the pin .
but if you make one step every time , maybe you don &apos;t care as much .
and i think that in the industrial revolution , adam smith was more correct than karl marx , but the reality is that we &apos;ve switched and now we &apos;re in the knowledge economy .
and you can ask yourself , what happens in a knowledge economy ?
is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
i think the answer is no .
i think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort , attention , caring , how connected they feel to it , are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on , all of a sudden marx has more things to say to us .
so when we think about labor , we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing , but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it -- meaning , creation , challenges , ownership , identity , pride , etc .
and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier .
dan ariely : what makes us feel good about our work ?
what motivates us to work ? contrary to conventional wisdom , it isn &apos;t just money . but it &apos;s not exactly joy either . it seems that most of us thrive by making constant progress and feeling a sense of purpose . behavioral economist dan ariely presents two eye-opening experiments that reveal our unexpected and nuanced attitudes toward meaning in our work . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
but today i &apos;ve got a personal story to share with you .
this is a picture of my family , my four siblings -- my mom and i -- taken in 1977 .
and this picture is taken in vietnam .
so how did a cambodian family end up in vietnam in 1977 ?
well to explain that , i &apos;ve got a short video clip to explain the khmer rouge regime during 1975 and 1979 .
april 17th , 1975 .
the communist khmer rouge enters phnom penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in vietnam , and american bombing campaigns .
led by peasant-born pol pot , the khmer rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia , much like mao tse-tung &apos;s cultural revolution in china .
the khmer rouge closes the doors to the outside world .
but after four years the grim truth seeps out .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
sophal ear : so , notwithstanding the 1970s narration , on april 17th 1975 we lived in phnom penh .
and my parents were told by the khmer rouge to evacuate the city because of impending american bombing for three days .
and here is a picture of the khmer rouge .
they were young soldiers , typically child soldiers .
and this is very normal now , of modern day conflict , because they &apos;re easy to bring into wars .
the reason that they gave about american bombing wasn &apos;t all that far off .
i mean , from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on cambodia than in all of world war ii japan , including the two nuclear bombs of august 1945 .
the khmer rouge didn &apos;t believe in money .
so the equivalent of the federal reserve bank in cambodia was bombed .
but not just that , they actually banned money .
i think it &apos;s the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used .
and we know money is the root of all evil , but it didn &apos;t actually stop evil from happening in cambodia , in fact .
my family was moved from phnom penh to pursat province .
it &apos;s actually a very pretty area of cambodia , where rice growing takes place .
and in fact they were forced to work the fields .
so my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp , labor camp .
and it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to vietnam .
and she spoke some vietnamese , as a child having grown up with vietnamese friends .
and she decided , despite the advice of her neighbors , that she would take the chance and claim to be vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive , because at this point they &apos;re forcing everybody to work .
and they &apos;re giving about -- in a modern-day , caloric-restriction diet , i guess -- they &apos;re giving porridge , with a few grains of rice .
and at about this time actually my father got very sick .
and he didn &apos;t speak vietnamese .
so he died actually , in january 1976 .
and it made it possible , in fact , for us to take on this plan .
so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev , which is across from the border from vietnam .
and there they had a detention camp where alleged vietnamese would be tested , language tested .
and my mother &apos;s vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible , she &apos;d given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names .
but she &apos;d given the boys girls &apos; names , and the girls boys &apos; names .
and it wasn &apos;t until she met a vietnamese lady who told her this , and then tutored her for two days intensively , that she was able to go into her exam and -- you know , this was a moment of truth .
if she fails , we &apos;re all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to vietnam .
and she actually , of course -- i &apos;m here , she passes .
and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side .
and then onwards to chau doc .
and this is a picture of hong ngu , vietnam today .
a pretty idyllic place on the mekong delta .
and freedom from persecution from the khmer rouge .
last year , the khmer rouge tribunal , which the u.n. is helping cambodia take on , started , and i decided that as a matter of record i should file a civil complaint with the tribunal about my father &apos;s passing away .
and i got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the khmer rouge tribunal .
and it &apos;s for me a matter of justice for history , and accountability for the future , because cambodia remains a pretty lawless place , at times .
five years ago my mother and i went back to chau doc .
and she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom , but also fear , because we had just come out of cambodia .
i &apos;m happy , actually , today , to present her .
she &apos;s here today with us in the audience .
thank you mother .
sophal ear : escaping the khmer rouge
fellow sophal ear shares the compelling story of his family &apos;s escape from cambodia under the rule of the khmer rouge . he recounts his mother &apos;s cunning and determination to save her children .
so i want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story -- about addressing desperation , depression and despair in afghanistan , and what we have learned from it , and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead -- in the future -- and how to participate again in everyday life .
so , i am a jungian psychoanalyst , and i went to afghanistan in january 2004 , by chance , on an assignment for medica mondiale .
jung in afghanistan -- you get the picture .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
you may know this from the media , but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is 17 years old , which means they grow up in such an environment and -- i repeat myself -- in 30 years of war .
so this translates into ongoing violence , foreign interests , bribery , drugs , ethnic conflicts , bad health , shame , fear and cumulative traumatic experiences .
local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations .
and people had hope , yes , but until they realized their situation worsens every day -- either because they are being killed or because , somehow , they are poorer than eight years ago .
one figure for that : 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition .
yet , there is hope .
this is a picture i took in 2005 , walking on fridays over the hills in kabul , and for me it &apos;s a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation .
so , doctors prescribe medication .
and donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads .
why ?
because people don &apos;t have tools to cope with it , to get over it .
so , soon after my arrival , i had confirmed something which i had already known ; that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe , yes .
however , what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds -- they are universal .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
after a counseling session , a woman said to me , &quot; because you have felt me , i can feel myself again , and i want to participate again in my family life . &quot;
this was very important , because the family is central in afghans &apos; social system .
no one can survive alone .
and if people feel used , worthless and ashamed , because something horrible has happened to them , then they retreat , and they fall into social isolation , and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones , because they do not want to burden them .
and very often violence is a way to cope with it .
traumatized people also easily lose control -- symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks -- so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly , suddenly , and they cannot control it .
to compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context .
so , husbands start beating wives , mothers and fathers beat their children , and afterward , they feel awful .
they did not want to do this , it just happened -- they lost control .
the desperate try to restore order and normality , and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence , it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt .
and partly this is already happening .
so everybody needs a sense for the future , and the afghan sense of the future is shattered .
but let me repeat the words of the woman .
&quot; because you have felt me , i can feel myself again . &quot;
somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .
somebody has to feel how you felt .
and somebody has to see you and listen to you .
everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true , and this only goes with another person .
so everybody must be able to say , &quot; this happened to me , and it did this with me , but i &apos;m able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it .
and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children , and i will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter , &quot; -- what happens too often in afghanistan .
so something can be done , even in such extreme environments as afghanistan .
and i started thinking about a counseling program .
but , of course , i needed help and funds .
and one evening , i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul , and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan .
and i explained to him quickly , i would train psycho-social counselors , i would open centers , and i explained to him why .
this man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said , &quot; if you want to do this , call me . &quot;
at that time , it was the head of caritas germany .
so , i was able to launch a three-year project with caritas germany , and we trained 30 afghan women and men , and we opened 15 counseling centers in kabul .
this was our sign -- it &apos;s hand-painted , and we had 45 all over kabul .
eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
and 70 percent regained their lives .
this was a very exciting time , developing this with my wonderful afghan team .
and they are working with me up to today .
we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
so , from 2008 up until today , a substantial change and step forward has been taking place .
the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health , to lobby this approach -- we succeeded .
this means , certainly , to retrain all health staff .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
so we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces , and you are the first to see the results .
we wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
and here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression , moderate and severe .
and the red line is the treatment as usual -- medication with a medical doctor .
and all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse .
and the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only , without medication .
and you can see the symptoms almost completely go away , and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly , which is explicable , because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses , but you can learn how to cope with them .
so this makes us very happy , because now we also have some evidence that this is working .
so here you see , this is a health facility in northern afghanistan , and every morning it looks like this all over .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
they go to the clinics , because they want to cure their immediate symptoms , and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions , develop their resources , learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future .
and i would like to share one short vignette .
one hazara said to his pashtun counselor , &quot; if we were to have met some years ago , then we would have killed each other .
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future . &quot;
and another counselor said to me after the training , &quot; you know , i never knew why i survived the killings in my village , but now i know , because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan . &quot;
so i believe this kept me running .
and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation .
and also -- i think -- without psycho-social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we cannot build-up civil societies .
i thought it was an idea worth spreading , and i think it must be , can be , could be replicated elsewhere .
i thank you for your attention .
when the industrial revolution started , the amount of carbon sitting underneath britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under saudi arabia in the form of oil , and this carbon powered the industrial revolution , it put the &quot; great &quot; in great britain , and led to britain &apos;s temporary world domination .
and then , in 1918 , coal production in britain peaked , and has declined ever since .
in due course , britain started using oil and gas from the north sea , and in the year 2000 , oil and gas production from the north sea also peaked , and they &apos;re now on the decline .
these observations about the finiteness of easily accessible , local , secure fossil fuels , this is a motivation for saying , &quot; well , what &apos;s next ?
what is life after fossil fuels going to be like ?
shouldn &apos;t we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels ? &quot;
another motivation , of course , is climate change .
and when people talk about life after fossil fuels and climate change action , i think there &apos;s a lot of fluff , a lot of greenwash , a lot of misleading advertising , and i feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions that really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do add up .
let me illustrate this with what physicists call a back-of-envelope calculation .
we love back-of-envelope calculations .
you ask a question , you write down some numbers , and you get yourself an answer .
it may not be very accurate , but it may make you say , &quot; hmm . &quot;
so here &apos;s a question : imagine if we said , &quot; oh yes , we can get off fossil fuels .
we &apos;ll use biofuels . problem solved .
transport , we don &apos;t need oil anymore . &quot;
well , what if we grew the biofuels for a road on the grass verge at the edge of the road ?
how wide would the verge have to be for that to work out ?
okay , so let &apos;s put in some numbers .
let &apos;s have our cars go at 60 miles per hour .
let &apos;s say they do 30 miles per gallon .
that &apos;s the european average for new cars .
let &apos;s say the productivity of biofuel plantations is 1,200 litres of biofuel per hectare per year .
and let &apos;s imagine the cars are spaced 80 meters apart from each other , and they &apos;re just perpetually going along this road .
the length of the road doesn &apos;t matter , because the longer the road , the more biofuel plantation we &apos;ve got .
what do we do with these numbers ?
well , you take the first number , and you divide by the other three , and you get eight kilometers .
and that &apos;s the answer .
that &apos;s how wide the plantation would have to be , given these assumptions .
and maybe that makes you say , &quot; hmm .
maybe this isn &apos;t going to be quite so easy . &quot;
and it might make you think , perhaps there &apos;s an issue to do with areas , and in this talk , i &apos;d like to talk about land areas , and ask , is there an issue about areas ? the answer is going to be yes but it depends which country you are in .
so let &apos;s start in the united kingdom , since that &apos;s where we are today .
the energy consumption of the united kingdom , the total energy consumption , not just transport , but everything , i like to quantify it in light bulbs .
it &apos;s as if we &apos;ve all got 125 light bulbs on all the time , 125 kilowatt-hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the u.k.
so there &apos;s 40 light bulbs &apos; worth for transport , 40 light bulbs &apos; worth for heating , and 40 light bulbs &apos; worth for making electricity , and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish .
it &apos;s actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well , and 90 percent of this energy today still comes from fossil fuels , and 10 percent only from other , greener -- possibly greener -- sources like nuclear power and renewables .
so , that &apos;s the u.k. , and the population density of the u.k.
is 250 people per square kilometer , and i &apos;m now going to show you other countries by these same two measures .
on the vertical axis , i &apos;m going to show you how much light bulbs -- what our energy consumption per person is , and we &apos;re at 125 light bulbs per person , and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area of the united kingdom , and the population density is on the horizontal axis , and we &apos;re 250 people per square kilometer .
let &apos;s add european countries in blue , and you can see there &apos;s quite a variety .
i should emphasize , both of these axes are logarithmic . as you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you &apos;re going up a factor of 10 .
next , let &apos;s add asia in red , the middle east and north africa in green , sub-saharan africa in blue , black is south america , purple is central america , and then in pukey-yellow , we have north america , australia and new zealand .
and you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions .
countries are different from each other .
top right , bahrain has the same energy consumption per person , roughly , as canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but their population density is a factor of 300 times greater , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
bottom right , bangladesh has the same population density as bahrain but consumes 100 times less per person .
bottom left , well , there &apos;s no one .
but there used to be a whole load of people .
here &apos;s another message from this diagram .
i &apos;ve added on little blue tails behind sudan , libya , china , india , bangladesh .
that &apos;s 15 years of progress .
where were they 15 years ago , and where are they now ?
and the message is , most countries are going to the right , and they &apos;re going up , up and to the right -- bigger population density and higher per capita consumption .
so , we may be off in the top right-hand corner , slightly unusual , the united kingdom accompanied by germany , japan , south korea , the netherlands , and a bunch of other slightly odd countries , but many other countries are coming up and to the right to come and join us , so we &apos;re a picture , if you like , of what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too .
and i &apos;ve also added in this diagram now some pink lines that go down and to the right .
those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area , which i measure in watts per square meter .
so , for example , the middle line there , 0.1 watts per square meter , is the energy consumption per unit area of saudi arabia , norway , mexico in purple , and bangladesh 15 years ago , and half of the world &apos;s population lives in countries that are already above that line .
the united kingdom is consuming 1.25 watts per square meter .
so &apos;s germany , and japan is consuming a bit more .
so , let &apos;s now say why this is relevant . why is it relevant ?
well , we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units , and renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our 90 percent fossil fuel habit .
so here come some renewables .
energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter in european climates .
what does that mean ? and you might have anticipated that result , given what i told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago .
well , we consume 1.25 watts per square meter .
what this means is , even if you covered the whole of the united kingdom with energy crops , you couldn &apos;t match today &apos;s energy consumption .
i &apos;ve got data to back up all these assertions , by the way .
next , let &apos;s look at solar power .
solar panels , when you put them on a roof , deliver about 20 watts per square meter in england .
if you really want to get a lot from solar panels , you need to adopt the traditional bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too .
solar parks , because of the gaps between the panels , deliver less . they deliver about 5 watts per square meter of land area .
and here &apos;s a solar park in vermont with real data delivering 4.2 watts per square meter .
remember where we are , 1.25 watts per square meter , wind farms 2.5 , solar parks about five .
so , whatever , whichever of those renewables you pick , the message is , whatever mix of those renewables you &apos;re using , if you want to power the u.k. on them , you &apos;re going to need to cover something like 20 percent or 25 percent of the country with those renewables .
and i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s a bad idea .
we just need to understand the numbers .
i &apos;m absolutely not anti-renewables . i love renewables .
but i &apos;m also pro-arithmetic .
concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area , because you don &apos;t have the problem of clouds , and so this facility delivers 14 watts per square meter , this one 10 watts per square meter , and this one in spain 5 watts per square meter .
yet .
all renewables , much as i love them , are diffuse .
they all have a small power per unit area , and we have to live with that fact .
and that means , if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the united kingdom on the scale of today &apos;s consumption , you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country-sized , not the entire country but a fraction of the country , a substantial fraction .
there are other options for generating power as well which don &apos;t involve fossil fuels .
so there &apos;s nuclear power , and on this ordnance survey map , you can see there &apos;s a sizewell b inside a blue square kilometer .
that &apos;s one gigawatt in a square kilometer , which works out to 1,000 watts per square meter .
so by this particular metric , nuclear power isn &apos;t as intrusive as renewables .
of course , other metrics matter too , and nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems .
here &apos;s a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of penicuik just outside edinburgh , and you can see the children of penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill .
so people are anti-everything , and we &apos;ve got to keep all the options on the table .
what can a country like the u.k. do on the supply side ?
well , the options are , i &apos;d say , these three : power renewables , and recognizing that they need to be close to country-sized ; other people &apos;s renewables , in the top left-hand side of the diagram and say , &quot; uh , we don &apos;t want renewables in our backyard , but , um , please could we put them in yours instead ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a serious option .
it &apos;s a way for the world to handle this issue .
so countries like australia , russia , libya , kazakhstan , could be our best friends for renewable production .
and a third option is nuclear power .
so that &apos;s some supply side options .
in addition to the supply levers that we can push , and remember , we need large amounts , because at the moment , we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels .
in addition to those levers , we could talk about other ways of solving this issue , namely , we could reduce demand , and that means reducing population — i &apos;m not sure how to do that — or reducing per capita consumption .
so let &apos;s talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side .
first , transport . here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport , and people often say , &quot; oh , yes , technology can answer everything .
we can make vehicles that are a hundred times more efficient . &quot; and that &apos;s almost true . let me show you .
the energy consumption of this typical tank here is 80 kilowatt-hours per hundred person kilometers .
that &apos;s the average european car .
eighty kilowatt-hours . can we make something a hundred times better by applying those physics principles i just listed ?
yes . here it is . it &apos;s the bicycle . it &apos;s 80 times better in energy consumption , and it &apos;s powered by biofuel , by weetabix .
and there are other options in between , because maybe the lady in the tank would say , &quot; no , no , no , that &apos;s a lifestyle change . don &apos;t change my lifestyle , please . &quot;
so , well , we could persuade her to get into a train , and that &apos;s still a lot more efficient than a car , but that might be a lifestyle change , or there &apos;s the eco-car , top-left .
it comfortably accommodates one teenager and it &apos;s shorter than a traffic cone , and it &apos;s almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour .
in between , perhaps some more realistic options on this lever , transport lever , are electric vehicles , so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle , perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol-powered tank .
heating is a third of our energy consumption in britain , and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings doing space heating and water heating .
so here &apos;s a typical crappy british house .
it &apos;s my house , with the ferrari out front .
what can we do to it ?
well , the laws of physics are written up there , which describe what -- how the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control .
the things you can control are the temperature difference between the inside and the outside , and there &apos;s this remarkable technology called a thermostat .
you grasp it , you rotate it to the left , and your energy consumption in the home will decrease .
i &apos;ve tried it . it works . some people call it a lifestyle change .
you can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building -- put fluff in the walls , fluff in the roof , and a new front door and so forth , and the sad truth is , this will save you money .
that &apos;s not sad , that &apos;s good , but the sad truth is , it &apos;ll only get about 25 percent of the leakiness of your building , if you do these things , which are good ideas .
if you really want to get a bit closer to swedish building standards with a crappy house like this , you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in london .
you can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity to move heat from your garden into your house .
the third demand side option i want to talk about , the third way to reduce energy consumption is , read your meters .
and people talk a lot about smart meters , but you can do it yourself .
use your own eyes and be smart , read your meter , and if you &apos;re anything like me , it &apos;ll change your life .
here &apos;s a graph i made .
i was writing a book about sustainable energy , and a friend asked me , &quot; well how much energy do you use at home ? &quot; and i was embarrassed . i didn &apos;t actually know .
and so i started reading the meter every week , and the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph , and then 2007 is shown in green at the bottom , and that was when i was reading the meter every week , and my life changed , because i started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference , and my gas consumption plummeted because i started tinkering with the thermostat and the timing on the heating system , and i knocked more than a half off my gas bills .
there &apos;s a similar story for my electricity consumption , where switching off the dvd players , the stereos , the computer peripherals that were on all the time , and just switching them on when i needed them , knocked another third off my electricity bills too .
so we need a plan that adds up , and i &apos;ve described for you six big levers , and we need big action because we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels , and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers .
and most of these levers have popularity problems , and if there is a lever you don &apos;t like the use of , well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers .
so i &apos;m a strong advocate of having grown-up conversations that are based on numbers and facts , and i want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just 16 light bulbs per person from four of the big possible sources .
if you wanted 16 from wind , this map visualizes a solution for the u.k. it &apos;s got 160 wind farms , each 100 square kilometers in size , and that would be a twentyfold increase over today &apos;s amount of wind .
nuclear power , to get 16 light bulbs per person , you &apos;d need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map .
that &apos;s a fourfold increase over today &apos;s levels of nuclear power .
biomass , to get 16 light bulbs per person , you &apos;d need a land area something like three and a half wales &apos; worth , either in our country , or in someone else &apos;s country , possibly ireland , possibly somewhere else .
and a fourth supply side option , concentrating solar power in other people &apos;s deserts , if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs &apos; worth , then we &apos;re talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right .
the total area of those hexagons is two greater london &apos;s worth of someone else &apos;s sahara , and you &apos;ll need power lines all the way across spain and france to bring the power from the sahara to surrey .
we need a plan that adds up .
we need to stop shouting and start talking , and if we can have a grown-up conversation , make a plan that adds up and get building , maybe this low-carbon revolution will actually be fun . thank you very much for listening .
david mackay : a reality check on renewables
how much land mass would renewables need to power a nation like the uk ? an entire country &apos;s worth . in this pragmatic talk , david mackay tours the basic mathematics that show worrying limitations on our sustainable energy options and explains why we should pursue them anyway . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
let &apos;s now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago .
jose antonio abreu : my dear friends , ladies and gentlemen , i am overjoyed today at being awarded the ted prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers , artists and educators from venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding , growing and developing in venezuela the national system of youth and children &apos;s orchestras and choirs .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician , and , thank god , i made it .
from my teachers , my family and my community , i had all the necessary support to become a musician .
all my life i &apos;ve dreamed that all venezuelan children have the same opportunity that i had .
stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country .
from the very first rehearsal , i saw the bright future ahead .
because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me .
i had received a donation of 50 music stands to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal .
when i arrived at the rehearsal , only 11 kids had shown up , and i said to myself , &quot; do i close the program or multiply these kids ? &quot;
i decided to face the challenge , and on that same night , i promised those 11 children i &apos;d turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world .
two months ago , i remembered that promise i made , when a distinguished english critic published an article in the london times , asking who could be the winner of the orchestra world cup .
today we can say that art in latin america is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right , a right for all the people .
there is no difference here between classes , nor white or black , nor if you have money or not .
simply , if you are talented , if you have the vocation and the will to be here , you get in . you share with us and make music .
j during the recent tour by the simon bolivar youth orchestra of venezuela of u.s. and europe , we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls , how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians , how the standing ovations , sometimes 30 minutes long , seemed to last forever , and how the public , after the concert was over , went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph .
this meant not only an artistic triumph , but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of latin america , as seen in venezuela , giving these audiences a message of music , vitality , energy , enthusiasm and strength .
in its essence , the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures .
they are examples and schools of social life , because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence , following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments .
that &apos;s how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them , develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses .
this is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility , in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids .
after all this time here , music is life .
nothing else .
music is life .
j each teenager and child in el sistema has his own story , and they are all important and of great significance to me .
let me mention the case of edicson ruiz .
he is a boy from a parish in caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the san agustin &apos;s junior orchestra .
with his effort , and the support of his mother , his family and his community , he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the berlin philharmonic orchestra .
we have another well-known case -- gustavo dudamel .
he started as a boy member of the children &apos;s orchestra in his hometown , barquisimeto .
there , he grew as a violinist and as a conductor .
he became the conductor of venezuela &apos;s junior orchestras , and today conducts the world &apos;s greatest orchestras .
he is the musical director of los angeles philharmonic , and is still the overall leader of venezuela &apos;s junior orchestras .
he was the conductor of the gothenburg symphony orchestra , and he &apos;s an unbeatable example for young musicians in latin america and the world .
it &apos;s a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever , but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups .
the effect of el sistema is felt in three fundamental circles : in the personal / social circle , in the family circle and in the community .
in the personal / social circle , the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side .
the music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being , thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality .
so , the emotional and intellectual profits are huge -- the acquisition of leadership , teaching and training principles , the sense of commitment , responsibility , generosity and dedication to others , and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals .
all this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence .
mother teresa of calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me : the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof , but the feeling of being no-one -- the feeling of not being anyone , the lack of identification , the lack of public esteem .
that &apos;s why the child &apos;s development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community .
it makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility , perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school .
within the family , the parents &apos; support is unconditional .
the child becomes a role model for both his parents , and this is very important for a poor child .
once the child discovers he is important to his family , he begins to seek new ways of improving himself and hopes better for himself and his community .
also , he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family .
all this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .
the large majority of our children belong , as i already mentioned , to the most vulnerable strata of the venezuelan population .
that encourages them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
finally , in the circle of the community , the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings .
the spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society .
it &apos;s what makes a child play a violin at home , while his father works in his carpentry .
it &apos;s what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home , while her mother does the housework .
the idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to .
the huge spiritual world that music produces in itself , which also lies within itself , ends up overcoming material poverty .
he becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level , who &apos;ll later become a full citizen .
needless to say that music is the number one prevention against prostitution , violence , bad habits , and everything degrading in the life of a child .
a few years ago , historian arnold toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis .
not an economic or social crisis , but a spiritual one .
i believe that to confront such a crisis , only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity , to mankind &apos;s deepest aspirations , and to the historic demands of our times .
education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge -- is the means to strive for a more perfect , more aware , more noble and more just society .
with passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to ted for its outstanding humanism , the scope of its principles , for its open and generous promotion of young values .
we hope that ted can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music , in which the social , communal , spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission .
no longer putting society at the service of art , and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite , but instead art at the service of society , at the service of the weakest , at the service of the children , at the service of the sick , at the service of the vulnerable , and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through the spirit of their human condition and the raising up of their dignity .
we are going live now to caracas .

if you think about the phone -- and intel has tested a lot of the things i &apos;m going to show you , over the last 10 years , in about 600 elderly households -- 300 in ireland , and 300 in portland -- trying to understand : how do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way ?
and if you think about the phone , right , it &apos;s something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time .
we &apos;re testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .
and a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone , and it &apos;s our system whispering to them which pill they need to take , and they fake like they &apos;re having a conversation with a friend .
and they &apos;re not embarrassed by a meds caddy that &apos;s ugly , that sits on their kitchen table and says , &quot; i &apos;m old . i &apos;m frail . &quot;
it &apos;s surreptitious technology that &apos;s helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time .
now , we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones .
because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it .
&quot; hello ? hey . &quot;
all right ? that &apos;s the first time .
&quot; hello ? uh , hey . &quot;
&quot; hello ? uh , who ?
oh , hey . &quot;
all right ? very big differences between the way i answered the phone the three times .
and as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time , down to the tenths of a microsecond , that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately , or they do a lot of what &apos;s called trouble talk , where they &apos;re like , &quot; wait , who is this ? oh . &quot; right ?
waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .
we call these behavioral markers .
there &apos;s lots of others . is the person going to the phone as quickly , when it rings , as they used to ?
is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem ?
has their voice gotten more quiet ? we &apos;re doing a lot of work with people with alzheimer &apos;s and particularly with parkinson &apos;s , where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with parkinson &apos;s patients may be the best early indicator of parkinson &apos;s five to 10 years before it shows up clinically .
but those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet .
when you pick up the phone , how much tremor are you having , and what is that like , and what is that trend like over a period of time ?
is it a dexterity problem ? is it the onset of arthritis ?
are you using the phone ? are you socializing less than you used to ?
and looking at that pattern . and what does that decline in social health mean , as a kind of a vital sign of the future ?
and then wow , what a radical idea , we -- except in the united states -- might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line .
wow , what a great day that will be once we &apos;re allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
so , these are what i would call behavioral markers .
and it &apos;s the whole field that we &apos;ve been trying to work on for the last 10 years at intel .
how do you put simple disruptive technologies , and the first of five phrases that i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk ?
how do we change behavior ?
how do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that &apos;s going to help us with prevention of disease , early onset of disease , and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time ?
now , why would intel let me spend a lot of time and money , over the last 10 years , trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers ?
we have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years .
we study people in rochester , new york .
we go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter , and their access to healthcare , and how much they socialize , is very different than in the summer .
if they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .
if they have a family member who is a key part of their care network , we fly and study them as well .
so , we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
it &apos;s because of the second slogan that i want to talk about .
ten years ago , when i started trying to convince intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living , this is what i called it : &quot; y2k + 10 . &quot;
you know , back in 2000 , we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers , and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000 , that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to .
it was right around new years .
and that switchover , when we had the larger number of older people on the planet , for the first time than younger people .
for the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic , that &apos;s the expectation from demographers , going forward .
and 10 years ago it seemed like i had a lot of time to convince intel to work on this . right ?
y2k + 10 was coming , the baby boomers starting to retire .
well folks , it &apos;s like we know these demographics here .
it &apos;s like the lights are on , but nobody &apos;s home on this demographic y2k + 10 problem . right ?
the health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that &apos;s coming , and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care , but deliver care in some radically different ways .
and in fact , it &apos;s upon us .
i mean you probably saw these headlines . this is catherine casey who is the first boomer to actually get social security .
she was born one second after midnight in 1946 .
a retired school teacher , there she is with a social security administrator .
the first boomer actually , we didn &apos;t even wait till 2011 , next year .
we &apos;re already starting to see early retirement occur this year .
all right , so it &apos;s here . this y2k + 10 problem is at our door .
this is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar , but somehow we can &apos;t sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it . we &apos;ll wait until it &apos;s more of a catastrophe , and react , as opposed to prepare for it .
so , one of the reasons it &apos;s so challenging to prepare for this y2k problem is , i want to argue , we have what i would call mainframe poisoning .
andy grove , about six or seven years ago , he doesn &apos;t even know or remember this , in a fortune magazine article he used the phrase &quot; mainframe healthcare , &quot; and i &apos;ve been extending and expanding this .
he saw it written down somewhere . he &apos;s like , &quot; eric that &apos;s a really cool concept . &quot;
i was like , &quot; actually it was your idea . you said it in a fortune magazine article .
i just extended it . &quot;
you know , this is the mainframe .
this mentality of traveling to and timesharing large , expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 .
this is the first general hospital in vienna .
and actually the second general hospital in vienna , in about 1850 , was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties .
and it &apos;s a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body , and divided care into departments and compartments .
and it was reflected in our architecture , it was reflected in the way that we taught students , and this mainframe mentality persists today .
now , i &apos;m not anti-hospital .
with my own healthcare problems , i &apos;ve taken drug therapies , i &apos;ve traveled to this hospital and others , many , many times .
but we worship the high hospital on a hill . right ?
and this is mainframe healthcare .
and just as 30 years ago we couldn &apos;t conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts , that we &apos;re carrying around in our cell phone today , and suddenly , computing , that used to be an expert driven system , it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare .
when intel does surveys all around the world and we say , &quot; quick response : healthcare . &quot;
the first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
the second that comes up is &quot; hospital . &quot; and the third is &quot; illness &quot; or &quot; sickness . &quot; right ?
we are wired , in our imagination , to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place .
our entire health reform discussion right now , health i.t. , when we talk with policy makers , equals &quot; how are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe ? &quot;
we &apos;re not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home .
and the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare . right ?
this is a very reactive , crisis-driven system .
we &apos;re doing 15-minute exams with patients .
we collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting , and we fix them up , like humpty-dumpty all over again , and send them home , and hope -- we might hand them a brochure , maybe an interactive website -- that they do as asked and don &apos;t come back into the mainframe .
and the problem is we can &apos;t afford it today , folks .
we can &apos;t afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured .
and now we want to do a double-double of the age wave coming through ?
we &apos;ve got to focus on the home .
we &apos;ve got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home . how do we be more proactive , prevention-driven ?
how do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7 ?
how do we get a personal baseline about what &apos;s going to work for you ?
how do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data , psychological data , relational data , in and on and around the home ?
and how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that &apos;s around us to change our behavior ?
that &apos;s what we need to do for our personal health model .
i want to give you a couple of examples . this is mimi from one of our studies -- in her 90s , had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls .
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household , or any of your loved ones , your parents or so forth . right ?
this is what was happening to mimi ; the family was worried about it , moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility .
she tripped over her oxygen tank .
many people in this generation won &apos;t press the button , even if they have an alert call system , because they don &apos;t want to bother anybody , even though they &apos;ve been paying 30 dollars a month .
boomers will press the button . trust me .
mimi broke her pelvis , lay all night , all morning , finally somebody came in and found her , sent her to the hospital .
they fixed her back up . she was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living . they put her into the nursing home unit .
first night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility , moved her from one bed to another , kind of threw her , rebroke her pelvis , sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from , no one read the chart , put her on tylenol , which she is allergic to , broke out , got bedsores , basically , had heart problems , and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there .
now , the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife &apos;s grandmother .
now , i &apos;m eric dishman . i speak english , i work for intel , i make a good salary , i &apos;m smart about falls and fall-related injuries -- it &apos;s an area of research that i work on .
i have access to senators and ceos .
i can &apos;t stop this from happening .
what happens if you don &apos;t have money , you don &apos;t speak english or don &apos;t have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur ?
how do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place ?
let me give you a quick example of work that we &apos;re doing to try to do exactly that .
i &apos;ve been wearing a little technology that we call shimmer .
it &apos;s a research platform .
it has accelerometry . you can plug in a three-lead ecg .
there is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of legos that you can do to capture , in the wild , in the real world , things like tremor , gait , stride length and those kinds of things .
the problem is , our understanding of falls today , like mimi , is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell , from the state , saying , &quot; what were you doing when you fell ? &quot;
but with something like shimmer , or we have something called the magic carpet , embedded sensors in carpet , or camera-based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine , we &apos;re starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand : what are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls ?
and most often we can do two interventions , fix the meds mix .
i &apos;m a qualitative researcher , but when i look at these data streams coming in from these homes , i can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on , because we see the changes in their patterns in the household . right ?
this is an example in our tril clinic in ireland of -- actually what you &apos;re seeing is she &apos;s looking at data , in this picture , from the magic carpet .
so , we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway , and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months .
this is actually sensor firings .
these are two different subjects in our study .
it &apos;s about a year &apos;s worth of data .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
this person on the left is living in their own home .
this person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility .
i know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here . right ?
but when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time -- and we &apos;re looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house , to sort of micro-motions that shimmer picks up , about gait and stride length -- these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we &apos;ve never understood before .
you can go to orcatech.org -- it has nothing to do with whales , it &apos;s the oregon center for aging and technology -- to see more about that .
the problem is , intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research .
i &apos;m not bragging about how much we fund ; it &apos;s how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging , chronic disease management and independent living in the home .
so , my mantra here , my fourth slogan is : 10,000 households or bust .
we need to drive a national , if not international , framingham-type heart study of independent living technologies , where we have 10,000 elderly connected households with broadband , full medical characterization , and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies that the universities fund , to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies .
so , 10,000 households or bust .
these are just some of the households that we &apos;ve done in the intel studies .
my fifth and final phrase : i have tried for two years , and there were moments when we were quite close , to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something , from a mainframe model to a personal health model , or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we &apos;re going to finance .
it doesn &apos;t matter how we finance healthcare .
we &apos;re going to figure something out for the next 10 years , and try it .
no matter who pays for it , we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways .
the president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a healthcare reform debate , &quot; our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clinics , hospitals and nursing homes , to the home , in 10 years . &quot;
but there is no goal within this health reform .
it &apos;s just a mess today .
so , you know , that &apos;s my last message to you .
how do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the y2k + 10 problem that &apos;s coming ?
and if we don &apos;t create a personal health movement , something that we &apos;re all aiming towards in reform , then we &apos;re going to move nowhere .
so , i hope you &apos;ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward .
thanks very much .
eric dishman : take health care off the mainframe
at tedmed , eric dishman makes a bold argument : the us health care system is like computing circa 1959 , tethered to big , unwieldy central systems : hospitals , doctors , nursing homes . as our aging population booms , it &apos;s imperative , he says , to create personal , networked , home-based health care for all .

i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cybercriminals &apos; latest and nastiest creations .
so basically , please don &apos;t go and download any of the viruses that i show you .
some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like , and i thought i &apos;d give you a quick insight into my career so far .
it &apos;s a pretty accurate description .
this is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like .
so today , computer viruses and trojans , designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars .
some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power , utilities and infrastructure .
let me give you a quick snapshot of what malicious code is capable of today .
right now , every second , eight new users are joining the internet .
today , we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses .
and , just to kind of tear down a myth here , lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus , it &apos;s because you went to a porn site .
right ? well , actually , statistically speaking , if you only visit porn sites , you &apos;re safer .
people normally write that down , by the way .
actually , about 80 percent of these are small business websites getting infected .
well , many of you have the image , don &apos;t you , of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement , hacking away for notoriety .
but actually today , cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized .
in fact , they have product adverts .
you can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline .
check out this one i found .
so you &apos;re here for one reason , and that reason is because you need your business competitors , rivals , haters , or whatever the reason is , or who , they are to go down .
well you , my friend , you &apos;ve came to the right place .
if you want your business competitors to go down , well , they can .
if you want your rivals to go offline , well , they will .
not only that , we are providing a short-term-to-long-term ddos service or scheduled attack , starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites to 10 to 50 dollars per hour .
james lyne : now , i did actually pay one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website .
things got a bit tricky when i tried to expense it at the company .
turns out that &apos;s not cool .
but regardless , it &apos;s amazing how many products and services are available now to cybercriminals .
for example , this testing platform , which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world .
for a small fee , they can upload it and make sure everything is good .
but it goes further .
cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code .
it comes with technical installation guides , video setup routines , and get this , technical support .
you can email the cybercriminals and they &apos;ll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server .
so let me show you what malicious code looks like today .
what i &apos;ve got here is two systems , an attacker , which i &apos;ve made look all matrix-y and scary , and a victim , which you might recognize from home or work .
now normally , these would be on different sides of the planet or of the internet , but i &apos;ve put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting .
now , there are many ways you can get infected .
you will have come in contact with some of them .
maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , &quot; hi , i &apos;m a nigerian banker , and i &apos;d like to give you 53 billion dollars because i like your face . &quot;
or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in china &apos;s recent campaign against america .
now there are many ways you can get infected .
i want to show you a couple of my favorites .
this is a little usb key .
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
well , you could try looking really cute .
awww .
or , in my case , awkward and pathetic .
so imagine this scenario : i walk into one of your businesses , looking very awkward and pathetic , with a copy of my c.v.
which i &apos;ve covered in coffee , and i ask the receptionist to plug in this usb key and print me a new one .
so let &apos;s have a look here on my victim computer .
after a couple of seconds , things start to happen on the computer on their own , usually a bad sign .
this would , of course , normally happen in a couple of seconds , really , really quickly , but i &apos;ve kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring .
malware is very boring otherwise .
now if i place the mouse cursor over it , this is what we call a command prompt , and using this we can navigate around the computer .
we can access your documents , your data .
you can turn on the webcam .
that can be very embarrassing .
or just to really prove a point , we can launch programs like my personal favorite , the windows calculator .
so isn &apos;t it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation ?
let me show you how most malware is now distributed today .
what i &apos;m going to do is open up a website that i wrote .
it &apos;s a terrible website . it &apos;s got really awful graphics .
and it &apos;s got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website .
many of you will have used something a bit like this before .
unfortunately , when this was implemented , the developer was slightly inebriated and managed to forget all of the secure coding practices he had learned .
so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker , called evil hacker just for comedy value , inserts something a little nasty .
this is a script .
it &apos;s code which will be interpreted on the webpage .
so i &apos;m going to submit this post , and then , on my victim computer , i &apos;m going to open up the web browser and browse to my website , www.incrediblyhacked.com.
notice that after a couple of seconds , i get redirected .
that website address at the top there , which you can just about see , microshaft.com , the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs , and up pops fake antivirus .
this is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software , and it will go through and it will scan the system , have a look at what its popping up here .
it creates some very serious alerts .
oh look , a child porn proxy server .
we really should clean that up .
now i liked it better when viruses were free .
people now pay cybercriminals money to run viruses , which i find utterly bizarre .
chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge , and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line , you &apos;ll note here .
so i want to talk to you briefly about a group of hackers we tracked for a year and actually found -- and this is a rare treat in our job .
now this was a cross-industry collaboration , people from facebook , independent researchers , guys from sophos .
so here we have a couple of documents which our cybercriminals had uploaded to a cloud service , kind of like dropbox or skydrive , like many of you might use .
what this would do is send the cybercriminals a text message every day telling them how much money they &apos;d made that day , so a kind of cybercriminal billings report , if you will .
if you look closely , you &apos;ll notice a series of what are russian telephone numbers .
now that &apos;s obviously interesting , because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals .
down below , highlighted in red , in the other section of source code , is this bit &quot; leded : leded . &quot;
that &apos;s a username , kind of like you might have on twitter .
so let &apos;s take this a little further .
there are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded .
lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference .
an interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo , it embeds gps data about where that photo was taken .
in fact , i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time on internet dating sites recently , obviously for research purposes , and i &apos;ve noticed that about 60 percent of the profile pictures on internet dating sites contain the gps coordinates of where the photo was taken , which is kind of scary because you wouldn &apos;t give out your home address to lots of strangers , but we &apos;re happy to give away our gps coordinates to plus or minus 15 meters .
and our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
so here &apos;s a photo which resolves to st. petersburg .
we then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool .
we used google .
using the email address , the telephone number and the gps data , on the left you see an advert for a bmw that one of our cybercriminals is selling , on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens .
one of these was more stereotypical for me .
imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room .
a bit more searching through the profile and there &apos;s a photo of their office .
they were working on the third floor .
and you can also see some photos from his business companion where he has a taste in a certain kind of image .
it turns out he &apos;s a member of the russian adult webmasters federation .
the cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well .
and herein is the greatest lesson of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now .
our friends , our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things .
this is mobsoft , one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned , and an interesting thing about mobsoft is the 50-percent owner of this posted a job advert , and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier .
this woman was maria , and maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals .
and it &apos;s kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really , really insecure .
by the end of the investigation , where you can read the full 27-page report at that link , we had photos of the cybercriminals , even the office christmas party when they were out on an outing .
that &apos;s right , cybercriminals do have christmas parties , as it turns out .
now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
let me come back to that in just a minute .
i want to change pace to one last little demonstration , a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic , but is interesting in exposing how much information we &apos;re all giving away , and it &apos;s relevant because it applies to us as a ted audience .
this is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately .
many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks .
you do it every time you take out your iphone or your blackberry and connect to something like tedattendees .
but what you might not know is that you &apos;re also beaming out a list of networks you &apos;ve previously connected to , even when you &apos;re not using wireless actively .
so i ran a little scan .
i was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals , who wouldn &apos;t be so concerned by law , and here you can see my mobile device .
tedattendees , hyattlb . where do you think i &apos;m staying ?
my home network , prettyflyforawifi , which i think is a great name .
sophos _ visitors , sansemea , companies i work with .
loganwifi , that &apos;s in boston . hiltonlondon .

we called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out , which is quite fun .
this is how geeks party .
so let &apos;s make this a little bit more interesting .
let &apos;s talk about you .
twenty-three percent of you have been to starbucks recently and used the wireless network .
things get more interesting .
forty-six percent of you i could link to a business , xyz employee network .
this isn &apos;t an exact science , but it gets pretty accurate .
seven hundred and sixty-one of you i could identify a hotel you &apos;d been to recently , absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe .
two hundred and thirty-four of you , well , i know where you live .
your wireless network name is so unique that i was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the internet with no hacking or clever , clever tricks .
and i should mention as well that some of you do use your names , &quot; james lyne &apos;s iphone , &quot; for example .
and two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity .
so something for you to think about : as we adopt these new applications and mobile devices , as we play with these shiny new toys , how much are we trading off convenience for privacy and security ?
next time you install something , look at the settings and ask yourself , &quot; is this information that i want to share ?
would someone be able to abuse it ? &quot;
we also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool .
there &apos;s a very concerning trend that whilst many people coming out of schools now are much more technology-savvy , they know how to use technology , fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects to know how that technology works under the covers .
in the u.k. , a 60 percent reduction since 2003 , and there are similar statistics all over the world .
we also need to think about the legal issues in this area .
the cybercriminals i talked about , despite theft of millions of dollars , actually still haven &apos;t been arrested , and at this point possibly never will .
most laws are national in their implementation , despite cybercrime conventions , where the internet is borderless and international by definition .
countries do not agree , which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective .
but my biggest ask is this : you see , you &apos;re going to leave here and you &apos;re going to see some astonishing stories in the news .
you &apos;re going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying , scary things .
however , 99 percent of it works because people fail to do the basics .
so my ask is this : go online , find these simple best practices , find out how to update and patch your computer .
make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online .
find these resources . apply them .
the internet is a fantastic resource for business , for political expression , for art and for learning .
help me and the security community make life much , much more difficult for cybercriminals .
thank you .
james lyne : everyday cybercrime -- and what you can do about it
how do you pick up a malicious online virus , the kind of malware that snoops on your data and taps your bank account ? often , it &apos;s through simple things you do each day without thinking twice . james lyne reminds us that it &apos;s not only the nsa that &apos;s watching us , but ever-more-sophisticated cybercriminals , who exploit both weak code and trusting human nature .
when i was growing up in montana , i had two dreams .
i wanted to be a paleontologist , a dinosaur paleontologist , and i wanted to have a pet dinosaur .
and so that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been striving for all of my life .
i was very fortunate early in my career .
i was fortunate in finding things .
i am extremely dyslexic , and so reading is the hardest thing i do .
but instead , i go out and i find things .
then i just pick things up .
i basically practice for finding money on the street .
and i wander about the hills , and i have found a few things .
and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests , the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones .
and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren &apos;t the big , stupid , green reptiles that people had thought for so many years .
people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special .
and so , at that time , i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .
we were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young , brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social .
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults .
the appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals .
in social groups of animals , the juveniles always look different than the adults .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
and so we &apos;re making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like .
but it is that social thing that i guess attracted michael crichton .
and in his book , he talked about the social animals .
and then steven spielberg , of course , depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures .
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur , and so we come to that part of &quot; jurassic park . &quot;
michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life .
i mean , i assume everyone here has seen &quot; jurassic park . &quot;
if you want to make a dinosaur , you go out , you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it , good ones , and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna , because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur dna out .
and you take your dna back to the laboratory and you clone it .
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg , or something like that , and then you wait , and , lo and behold , out pops a little baby dinosaur .
and everybody &apos;s happy about that .
and they &apos;re happy over and over again .
they keep doing it ; they just keep making these things .
and then , then , then , and then ...
then the dinosaurs , being social , act out their socialness , and they get together , and they conspire .
and , of course , that &apos;s what makes steven spielberg &apos;s movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around .
so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it , and you drilled into it , and you got something out of that insect , and you cloned it , and you did it over and over and over again , you &apos;d have a room full of mosquitos .
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
now if you want dinosaur dna , i say go to the dinosaur .
back in 1993 when the movie came out , we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur , and we chose the dinosaur on the left , a tyrannosaurus rex , which was a very nice specimen .
and one of my former doctoral students , dr. mary schweitzer , actually had the background to do this sort of thing .
and so she looked into the bone of this t. rex , one of the thigh bones , and she actually found some very interesting structures in there .
they found these red circular-looking objects , and they looked , for all the world , like red blood cells .
and they &apos;re in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone .
and so she thought , well , what the heck .
so she sampled some material out of it .
now it wasn &apos;t dna ; she didn &apos;t find dna .
but she did find heme , which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin .
that was interesting .
that was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme .
so a few years went by , and then we started the hell creek project .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
and out in eastern montana there &apos;s a lot of space , a lot of badlands , and not very many people , and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff .
and we did find a lot of stuff .
we found a lot of tyrannosaurs , but we found one special tyrannosaur , and we called it b-rex .
and b-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock .
it wasn &apos;t a very complete t. rex , and it wasn &apos;t a very big t. rex , but it was a very special b-rex .
and i and my colleagues cut into it , and we were able to determine , by looking at lines of arrested growth , some lines in it , that b-rex had died at the age of 16 .
we don &apos;t really know how long dinosaurs lived , because we haven &apos;t found the oldest one yet .
but this one died at the age of 16 .
we gave samples to mary schweitzer , and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .
medullary tissue is the calcium build-up , the calcium storage basically , when an animal is pregnant , when a bird is pregnant .
so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs .
but mary went further .
she took the bone , and she dumped it into acid .
now we all know that bones are fossilized , and so if you dump it into acid , there shouldn &apos;t be anything left .
but there was something left .
there were blood vessels left .
there were flexible , clear blood vessels .
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur .
but she also found osteocytes , which are the cells that laid down the bones .
and try and try , we could not find dna , but she did find evidence of proteins .
but we thought maybe -- well , we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground .
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast .
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer , and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .
and we did . we got better material .
the cells looked better .
the vessels looked better .
found the protein collagen .
but it &apos;s not dinosaur dna .
so we have discovered that dinosaur dna , and all dna , just breaks down too fast .
we &apos;re just not going to be able to do what they did in &quot; jurassic park . &quot;
we &apos;re not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur .
but birds are dinosaurs .
birds are living dinosaurs .
we actually classify them as dinosaurs .
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds .
so we don &apos;t have to make a dinosaur because we already have them .
i know , you &apos;re as bad as the sixth-graders .
the sixth-graders look at it and they say , &quot; no . &quot;
&quot; the chicken is not . &quot;
so this is our problem , as you can imagine .
the chicken is a dinosaur .
i mean it really is .
you can &apos;t argue with it because we &apos;re the classifiers and we &apos;ve classified it that way .
but the sixth-graders demand it .
&quot; fix the chicken . &quot;
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m here to tell you about : how we are going to fix a chicken .
so we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken .
because evolution works , we actually have some evolutionary tools .
we &apos;ll call them biological modification tools .
we have selection .
and we know selection works .
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese .
i mean , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s definitely genetic modification .
or any of the other funny-looking little dogs .
we also have transgenesis .
transgenesis is really cool too .
that &apos;s where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one .
that &apos;s how people make glofish .
you take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish , and , puff , they glow .
and that &apos;s pretty cool .
and now they &apos;re making glow-rabbits and glow-all-sorts-of-things .
i guess we could make a glow chicken .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;ll satisfy the sixth-graders either .
but there &apos;s another thing .
and atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic .
you heard that occasionally children are born with tails , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s an ancestral characteristic .
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen .
snakes are occasionally born with legs .
and here &apos;s an example .
this is a chicken with teeth .
a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth , and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens .
now that &apos;s a good characteristic .
we can save that one .
we know we can use that .
we can make a chicken with teeth .
that &apos;s getting closer .
that &apos;s better than a glowing chicken .
a friend of mine , a colleague of mine , dr. hans larsson at mcgill university , is actually looking at atavisms .
and he &apos;s looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop , and he &apos;s interested in how birds actually lost their tail .
he &apos;s also interested in the transformation of the arm , the hand , to the wing .
he &apos;s looking for those genes as well .
and i said , &quot; well , if you can find those , i can just reverse them and make what i need to make for the sixth-graders . &quot;
if you look at dinosaur hands , a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it .
archaeopteryx , which is a bird , a primitive bird , still has that very primitive hand .
but as you can see , the pigeon , or a chicken or anything else , another bird , has kind of a weird-looking hand , because the hand is a wing .
but the cool thing is that , if you look in the embryo , as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand .
it has the three fingers , the three digits .
but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together .
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
and the same goes for the tails .
birds have basically rudimentary tails .
and so we know that in embryo , as the animal is developing , it actually has a relatively long tail .
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail , gets rid of it .
so that &apos;s the other gene we &apos;re looking for .
we want to stop that tail from resorbing .
so what we &apos;re trying to do really is take our chicken , modify it and make the chickenosaurus .
it &apos;s a cooler-looking chicken .
but it &apos;s just the very basics .
so that really is what we &apos;re doing .
and people always say , &quot; why do that ?
why make this thing ?
what good is it ? &quot;
well , that &apos;s a good question .
actually , i think it &apos;s a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things .
anyway -- when our dino-chicken hatches , it will be , obviously , the poster child , or what you might call a poster chick , for technology , entertainment and design .
thank you .
jack horner : building a dinosaur from a chicken
renowned paleontologist jack horner has spent his career trying to reconstruct a dinosaur . he &apos;s found fossils with extraordinarily well-preserved blood vessels and soft tissues , but never intact dna . so , in a new approach , he &apos;s taking living descendants of the dinosaur and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits — including teeth , tails , and even hands — to make a &quot; chickenosaurus &quot; .
the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was 15 years old .
i bought some pigs . i was living in sussex .
and i started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way .
i went to my school kitchen , and i said , &quot; give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at . &quot;
i went to the local baker and took their stale bread .
i went to the local greengrocer , and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets .
this was great . my pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork . i sold that pork to my school friends &apos; parents , and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance .
but i noticed that most of the food that i was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption , and that i was only scratching the surface , and that right the way up the food supply chain , in supermarkets , greengrocers , bakers , in our homes , in factories and farms , we were hemorrhaging out food .
supermarkets didn &apos;t even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting .
i &apos;d been round the back . i &apos;d seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites , and i thought , surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it .
one morning , when i was feeding my pigs , i noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time .
i grabbed hold of it , sat down , and ate my breakfast with my pigs .
that was the first act of what i later learned to call freeganism , really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste , and the provision of the solution to food waste , which is simply to sit down and eat food , rather than throwing it away .
that became , as it were , a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food , and exposing , most importantly , to the public , that when we &apos;re talking about food being thrown away , stuff that &apos;s beyond the pale .
we &apos;re talking about good , fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale .
eventually , i set about writing my book , really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale . what this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste .
there will always be waste . i &apos;m not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste-free world .
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good , stable , secure , nutritional diet for every person in that country .
any dot above that line , and you &apos;ll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world , represents unnecessary surplus , and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country .
as a country gets richer , it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants , and as you can see , most european and north american countries fall between 150 and 200 percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations .
so a country like america has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the american people .
but the thing that really struck me , when i plotted all this data , and it was a lot of numbers , was that you can see how it levels off .
countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark , and then they level off , and they don &apos;t really go on rising as you might expect .
so i decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false .
and that &apos;s what i came up with .
if you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants , but also the food that people feed to livestock , the maize , the soy , the wheat , that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products , what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself .
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs .
when people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by 2050 , i always think of these graphs .
the fact is , we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger .
we &apos;ve never had such gargantuan surpluses before .
in many ways , this is a great success story of human civilization , of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago .
it is a success story . it has been a success story .
but what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear , and when we chop down forests , as we are every day , to grow more and more food , when we extract water from depleting water reserves , when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food , and then we throw away so much of it , we have to think about what we can start saving .
and yesterday , i went to one of the local supermarkets that i often visit to inspect , if you like , what they &apos;re throwing away .
i found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there .
and i thought , well this could serve as a symbol for today .
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
the first biscuit we &apos;re going to lose before we even leave the farm .
that &apos;s a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture , whether it &apos;s a lack of infrastructure , refrigeration , pasteurization , grain stores , even basic fruit crates , which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields .
the next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock , the maize , the wheat and the soya .
unfortunately , our beasts are inefficient animals , and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat , so we &apos;ve lost those two , and we &apos;ve only kept this one in meat and dairy products .
two more we &apos;re going to throw away directly into bins .
this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste , what ends up in the garbage , what ends up in supermarket bins , what ends up in restaurant bins . we &apos;ve lost another two , and we &apos;ve left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on .
that is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources , especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world .
having gone through the data , i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up .
where does it end up ? we &apos;re used to seeing the stuff on our plates , but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between ?
supermarkets are an easy place to start .
this is the result of my hobby , which is unofficial bin inspections .
strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn &apos;t need to go sneaking around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what &apos;s inside .
but this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in britain , in europe , in north america .
it represents a colossal waste of food , but what i discovered whilst i was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg .
when you start going up the supply chain , you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale .
can i have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house ?
who lives in a household where that crust -- that slice at the first and last end of each loaf -- okay , most people , not everyone , but most people , and this is , i &apos;m glad to say , what i see across the world , and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it ?
i certainly haven &apos;t .
so i kept on thinking , where do those crusts go ?
this is the answer , unfortunately : 13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day , day-fresh bread .
in the same year that i visited this factory , i went to pakistan , where people in 2008 were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies .
we contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in britain and elsewhere in the world . we take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on .
this farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach , not one leaf of which he harvested , potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect , all going for pigs .
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications , tomatoes in tenerife , oranges in florida , bananas in ecuador , where i visited last year , all being discarded . this is one day &apos;s waste from one banana plantation in ecuador .
all being discarded , perfectly edible , because they &apos;re the wrong shape or size .
if we do that to fruit and vegetables , you bet we can do it to animals too .
liver , lungs , heads , tails , kidneys , testicles , delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste . offal consumption has halved in britain and america in the last 30 years .
as a result , this stuff gets fed to dogs at best , or is incinerated .
this man , in kashgar , xinjiang province , in western china , is serving up his national dish .
it &apos;s called sheep &apos;s organs .
it &apos;s delicious , it &apos;s nutritious , and as i learned when i went to kashgar , it symbolizes their taboo against food waste .
i was sitting in a roadside cafe .
a chef came to talk to me , i finished my bowl , and halfway through the conversation , he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl .
i thought , &quot; my goodness , what taboo have i broken ?
how have i insulted my host ? &quot;
he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl , and he said , &quot; clean . &quot;
i thought , &quot; my god , you know , i go around the world telling people to stop wasting food .
this guy has thrashed me at my own game . &quot;
but it gave me faith . it gave me faith that we , the people , do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale , if we make noise about it , tell corporations about it , tell governments we want to see an end to food waste , we do have the power to bring about that change .
fish , 40 to 60 percent of european fish are discarded at sea , they don &apos;t even get landed .
in our homes , we &apos;ve lost touch with food .
this is an experiment i did on three lettuces .
who keeps lettuces in their fridge ?
most people . the one on the left was kept in a fridge for 10 days .
the one on the right i treated like cut flowers .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
some food waste , as i said at the beginning , will inevitably arise , so the question is , what is the best thing to do with it ?
i answered that question when i was 15 .
in fact , humans answered that question 6,000 years ago : we domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food .
and yet , in europe , that practice has become illegal since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
it &apos;s unscientific . it &apos;s unnecessary .
if you cook food for pigs , just as if you cook food for humans , it is rendered safe .
it &apos;s also a massive saving of resources .
at the moment , europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from south america , where its production contributes to global warming , to deforestation , to biodiversity loss , to feed livestock here in europe .
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them .
if we did that , and fed it to pigs , we would save that amount of carbon .
if we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste , to anaerobic digestion , which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity , you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste . it &apos;s much better to feed it to pigs .
we knew that during the war .
a silver lining : it has kicked off globally , the quest to tackle food waste .
feeding the 5,000 is an event i first organized in 2009 .
we fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted .
since then , it &apos;s happened again in london , it &apos;s happening internationally , and across the country .
it &apos;s a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food , to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it , and to stop wasting it .
for the sake of the planet we live on , for the sake of our children , for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us , we are a terrestrial animal , and we depend on our land for food . at the moment , we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats .
stop wasting food . thank you very much .
tristram stuart : the global food waste scandal
i am going to be talking about secrets .
obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it .
secrets . i &apos;m using powerpoint this year just because , you know , i &apos;m into the ted thing .
and when you use these things you don &apos;t have to go like that .
you just press it .
oh , man . um , yes .
yes . i &apos;m sure ! just change it !
is bill gates here ?
change it ! come on ! what ?
ah ! okay .
that &apos;s not my slides , but it &apos;s okay .
as you can see , these are all maps .
and maps are important devices for transferring information , especially if you have human cognitive ability .
we can see that all formulas are really maps .
now , as humans , we make maps of places that we seldom even go , which seems a little wasteful of time .
this , of course , is a map of the moon .
there &apos;re some very delightful names .
what are these people thinking ? frigoris ?
what the frigoris you doing ? names are important .
frigoris ? this is the moon . people could live there one day .
i &apos;ll meet you at frigoris . no . i don &apos;t think so .
there we see mars , again with various names .
this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects .
this is from their actual book .
these are some of the names that they have chosen , ladies and gentlemen .
i &apos;ll go through a little of them . bolotnitsa .
that , of course , is the slavic swamp mermaid .
now i think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn &apos;t really blend into the swamp feel .
&quot; oh look ! mermaid come out of swamp . oh boy !
it &apos;s time for bolotnitsa ! &quot;
djabran fluctus .
if that don &apos;t flow off the tongue , what does ?
i mean kids are studying this stuff and they &apos;ve got the word &quot; fluctus &quot; up there . that &apos;s wrong .
one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life .
&quot; it fluctus up , mama . &quot;
hikuleo fluctus .
that &apos;s a little more flowing . hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio 17 syllable thing .
and that &apos;s the tonga underworld .
and one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus , who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects , stars , and planets .
now , if you &apos;re a goddess of stars and planets wouldn &apos;t you relegate insects to somebody else ?
&quot; no , no , really , i &apos;m so busy with the stars .
would you mind taking the insects ? thank you darling .
oh take the spiders too . i know they &apos;re not insects , but i don &apos;t care .
monkeys , chimps , just get rid of the hairy creatures . &quot;
so , you &apos;ll be on mars , and you &apos;re at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really &quot; up &quot; place .
yeah , i &apos;m at the depressio , and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map , and click the button and there &apos;s my directions .
i go to chrysokeras .
left to the thymiamata .
then to niliacus lacus , which is not a bad name .
niliacus lacus , try to get the practice , slick-a-tick-a-bacus .
that &apos;s a cool name . i will say that .
so , i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers .
and then of course arnon to thoth .
and of course there will be advertisements .
this is from their rule book , the international astronomical union .
and you know they &apos;re international because they put it &quot; en francais &quot; as well .
l &apos;union astronomique internationale , for those of you who don &apos;t speak french .
i thought i &apos;d translate for you .
from the rulebook : nomenclature is a tool .
the first consideration , make it clear , simple and unambiguous .
and i think that djabran fluctus , that fits that mode .
that &apos;s simple , the goddess of goats , very simple .
djabran fluctus .
&quot; now , frank is this clear to you , djabran fluctus ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , that &apos;s the goat goddess right ? the abacazanian ?
it &apos;s clear to me . &quot;
also , from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest .
anyone can suggest changing a name .
so , i look to you , fellow member of the earth community .
we &apos;ve got to change this stuff up fast .
so , these are actual names of people that work there .
i did some more investigation .
these are more people working for this group .
and , as you can see , they don &apos;t use their first names .
these are people naming planets , and they won &apos;t use their first names .
something is askew here .
is it because his name is really jupiter blunck ?
is that ganymede andromeda burba ?
is that mars ya marov ?
i don &apos;t know . but it &apos;s investigative material , no doubt .
there are some mapping people who do use their names .
witness please , eugene shoemaker , who , diligently , from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies .
must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house .
&quot; mom , i want to make maps . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful eugene . you could make maps of toronto . &quot;
&quot; no , i want to make maps of planets . &quot;
&quot; yeah , go to your room . &quot;
martians , venusians , jovians .
that seems a little silly to me .
there are no jovians .
getting back to my premise , i used stamps , by the way , because you don &apos;t have to pay anybody for the rights .
there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james coburn or richard harris .
it &apos;s definitely one of the two . i &apos;m not really clear which one .
but obviously the point is that numbers are maps .
and within numbers , is there an underlying secret to the universe ?
that is the premise of this particular presentation .
by the way , that &apos;s a natural picture of saturn , no adjustments . i mean that &apos;s just beautiful .
so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet , and the day saturday , named after it , wonderfully .
so , formulas relate number to form .
that &apos;s euler , his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool , not that funny , but it is cool .
he was also famous for having no body .
which a lot of you are like , &quot; how did he figure that out ? &quot;
he &apos;s got no body , no man , just a head floating high .
here comes euler .
and that &apos;s an icosahedron , which is one of the five sacred solids , very important shapes .
you see the icosahedron again .
the dodecahedron , it &apos;s dual .
there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night .
the five sacred solids , as you can see there .
which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads .
i suggest the house .
the reality , now here is something important .
what &apos;s important about this is these shapes are duals of each other .
and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other .
so , the whole concept of branes in the universe , if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be .
and that is , of course , what we are here to talk about .
what a coincidence !
october 9th , in france , jean-pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe .
but what they &apos;re seeing , way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background , is this kind of odd undulation .
it doesn &apos;t plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be .
so , you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture , so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like .
and judging from this , it looks a little like a cheeseburger .
so , i &apos;m thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger .
and for me , that &apos;s a win-win .
everybody goes , i &apos;m happy .
better really hurry up .
i just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are , without heart and without love it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s all meaningless .
and that , to me , is really beautiful .
except for that creepy guy in the background .
getting back to the point of my particular presentation , kepler , one of my great heroes , who realized that these five solids , which i spoke of earlier , were related somehow to the planets , but he couldn &apos;t prove it . it freaked him out .
but it did lead to newton discovering gravity .
so , maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge .
i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there . but ...
that &apos;s not a good picture .
not a good picture . now , my friends in the island of nevis are a little better . look at that ! that &apos;s isaac newton .
that guy is rockin &apos; .
what a handsome cat .
once again , nicaragua let me down .
and copernicus looks like johnny carson , which is really weird .
i don &apos;t get that at all .
once again , these guys rock it out .
isaac is kickin &apos; ass . man , he looks like a rock star .
this is sierra leone .
they got little babies in there , floating in there .
man . i don &apos;t really need to comment on this .
but i didn &apos;t know that isaac newton was in the moody blues . did you ?
when did this happen ?
it &apos;s a different kind of course . and they &apos;ve got five apples ?
i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid .
although five is a good number , of course .
ecuador , my friend kepler , as you can see , they call him juan .
juan ? no ! johannes , not juan .
it wasn &apos;t carlos chaplain . it &apos;s wrong .
rené descartes , of course . once again these grenada people , this is like way too sick for anybody &apos;s imagination .
this is , of course , the cartesian coordinates .
once again , that &apos;s sierra leone .
this is again , indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form , maps of the universe .
because that &apos;s why we &apos;re here , really , i think to figure stuff out and to love each other .
before the horse .
now , monaco took descartes , and just flipped him around .
now , monaco is problematic for me , and i &apos;ll show you why .
here is a map . all they have is a casino on it .
and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i don &apos;t even want to hazard a guess .
but i &apos;d say he &apos;d been to hellespointica depressio recently .
this is the flag of monaco . ladies and gentlemen , the flag of indonesia . please examine .
not sure how this came to be , but it &apos;s not right .
in monaco , &quot; no , what are you talking about ?
they are so different .
look , ours is more red , it &apos;s longer .
they stole our flag ! they stole our flag ! &quot;
bode &apos;s law wasn &apos;t even his law . it was a guy named titus .
and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn &apos;t really work .
that &apos;s jude law and some of his films recently didn &apos;t work .
just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted .
and i wonder if the photographer said , &quot; okay , jude , could you touch your tooth ? that &apos;s good . &quot;
just a tip , if you &apos;re being photographed for press pictures , don &apos;t touch your teeth .
golden section , i &apos;ve been obsessed with this thing since before i was born .
i know that scares a lot of you , but that was my purpose entirely .
there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section , because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter , as i refer to it .
if fibonacci had been on paxil , that would be the fibonacci series .
&quot; ten milligram , 20 milligram . &quot;
&quot; leonardo , dinner &apos;s ready , put down those books and take your pills . &quot;
&quot; yes , mama . &quot;
alright where is this going ? that &apos;s a good question .
here is the premise that i began 27 years ago .
if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live , i reason , through some sort of reverse engineering , we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe .
and that &apos;s what i did . twenty-seven years ago i started working on this .
and i tried to build a particle accelerator .
and that didn &apos;t work out well .
so , then i thought a calculator is a metaphor .
i can just divide numbers , that &apos;s like atom smashing .
that &apos;s what i did . that &apos;s how i found moleeds .
moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved .
they are the nodes on the string , patterns and relationships , 27 , 37 .
that was the first chart i came up with .
you can see , even if you don &apos;t go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry .
the numbers from one to 36 , divided into six groups .
symmetry , pairs .
there is so many intricate relationships that i &apos;m not going to go there now , because you would say , &quot; hey , go back to the fluctus part . &quot;
circle of fifths , acoustic harmony , geometric symmetry .
i knew those two were related .
once again , the cartesian kind of cross-over .
so , i said if i &apos;m going to put a circle , see what kind of patterns i get , boom , the red system .
look at that . you can &apos;t just make this stuff up , ladies and gentlemen .
you can &apos;t just go around going , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to put some triangles in a circle and they &apos;re going to be symmetrical . and they &apos;re all going to add up , and it &apos;s going to be , oh yeah , i figured that out . &quot;
this is beyond anything anybody could just make up .
there is the orange system .
and you &apos;ll see over here , these are multiples of the number 27 .
and they recapitulate that shape , even though that &apos;s a circle of nine and that &apos;s a circle of 36 . it &apos;s nuts .
that &apos;s the green system . it all folds in half on the green system , right between 18 and 19 .
the blue system . the violet . it &apos;s all there .
look at that ! i mean you cannot make that stuff up .
that just doesn &apos;t fall out of a tree , ladies and gentlemen .
twenty-seven years of my life !
and i &apos;m presenting it here at ted . why ?
because this is the place if aliens land , i hope they come here .
&quot; we are going to destroy the earth . hmmm ... maybe not . &quot;
in this last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi-yau manifolds in a way that doesn &apos;t necessitate these little hidden dimensions .
which works mathematically , but it just doesn &apos;t seem god-like to me .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sexy and elegant , it &apos;s hidden .
i found other pairs all have symmetry , even though , unlike the master one , their symmetry is split .
unbelievable . this is like crazy .
am i the only one that sees this ?
you know , i didn &apos;t just draw this in a day , by the way .
you know , try making some charts like this at home .
you gotta be accurate ! there &apos;s measurement involved , increments .
not stamps , but one day .
okay , i &apos;m getting to the punch . golden ratio , it &apos;s crazy .
and look at this , built within it is the golden ratio .
i start looking at that , and look at them again .
they start looking like planets .
i look at the orbits of the planets .
i find 18 examples of it in our solar system .
i never told anybody . this is the first thing . this could be history .
kepler was right .
eighteen and 19 , the middle of the moleeds , 0.618 is the golden section .
multiply them together , 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247 .
which is .005 different from the number of days in a year .
hey , you can &apos;t make this up .
thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you .
in a presentation that can only be described as epic , comedian charles fleischer delivers a hysterical send-up of a time-honored theme : the map . geometry , numbers , charts and stamp art also factor in , as he weaves together a unique theory of everything called &quot; moleeds . &quot;
so , this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982 .
actually , it &apos;s deceptively large .
there &apos;s actually only about 20 people on each page , because we have the name , address and telephone number of every single person .
and , in fact , everybody &apos;s listed twice , because it &apos;s sorted once by name and once by email address .
obviously a very small community .
there were only two other dannys on the internet then .
i knew them both .
we didn &apos;t all know each other , but we all kind of trusted each other , and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network , and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things .
so just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community , let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days .
now , it just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet .
so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
so i picked think.com , but then i thought , you know , there &apos;s a lot of really interesting names out there .
maybe i should register a few extras just in case .
and then i thought , &quot; nah , that wouldn &apos;t be very nice . &quot;
that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it wasn &apos;t just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself .
so the basic idea of i.p. , or internet protocol , and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it , were fundamentally &quot; from each according to their ability , to each according to their need . &quot;
and so , if you had some extra bandwidth , you &apos;d deliver a message for someone .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
you &apos;d kind of depend on people to do that , and that was the building block .
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the internet .
it was incredibly successful .
my rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
but , of course , you couldn &apos;t do it , because we don &apos;t know the names of all the people with internet or email addresses , and even if we did know their names , i &apos;m pretty sure that they would not want their name , address and telephone number published to everyone .
so the fact is that there &apos;s a lot of bad guys on the internet these days , and so we dealt with that by making walled communities , secure subnetworks , vpns , little things that aren &apos;t really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks , but we &apos;re still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust .
and that means that it &apos;s vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen , or certain kinds of deliberate attacks , but even the mistakes can be bad .
so , for instance , in all of asia recently , it was impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube in its internal network .
they didn &apos;t intend to screw up asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work .
another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is , you may remember a couple of years ago , all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city had a bug in it .
now , you don &apos;t really think that our airplane system depends on the internet , and in some sense it doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll come back to that later .
but the fact is that people couldn &apos;t take off because something was going wrong on the internet , and the router card was down .
and so , there are many of those things that start to happen .
now , there was an interesting thing that happened last april .
so for a few hours , it all passed through china .
now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days , they &apos;re not going to do it with tanks .
that will not succeed .
what they &apos;ll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility .
nobody has claimed credit for that .
there was basically a factory of industrial machines .
it didn &apos;t think of itself as being on the internet .
it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a usb drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the centrifuges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves .
and so there &apos;s a lot of -- i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve read a lot in papers , about worries about cyber attacks and defenses against those .
but the fact is , people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet , and there &apos;s been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium .
and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
back when it was the arpanet , there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it .
and the way the internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places , and this one processor , because of a broken card , decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time .
so , in other words , it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it .
so of course , the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy , who would send it back in time and get it there super early , so every message in the internet started getting switched through this one node , and of course that clogged everything up .
everything started breaking .
the interesting thing was , though , that the sysadmins were able to fix it , but they had to basically turn every single thing on the internet off .
now , of course you couldn &apos;t do that today .
i mean , everything off , it &apos;s like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
now , in fact , they couldn &apos;t do it for a lot of reasons today .
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we &apos;re becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you &apos;re really not thinking you &apos;re using the internet .
when you pump gas , you really don &apos;t think you &apos;re using the internet .
what &apos;s happening increasingly , though , is these systems are beginning to use the internet .
most of them aren &apos;t based on the internet yet , but they &apos;re starting to use the internet for service functions , for administrative functions , and so if you take something like the cell phone system , which is still relatively independent of the internet for the most part , internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions , and it &apos;s so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well , they &apos;re cheap , they &apos;re repeated , and so on .
so all of our systems , more and more , and starting to depend on this technology .
that &apos;s crazy . it was never designed to do things like that .
so we &apos;ve built this system where we understand all the parts of it , but we &apos;re using it in a very , very different way than we expected to use it , and it &apos;s gotten a very , very different scale than it was designed for .
and in fact , nobody really exactly understands all the things it &apos;s being used for right now .
it &apos;s turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system , where we &apos;ve designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have .
and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather , or something like that .
so if you see one of these maps of the internet , it &apos;s just somebody &apos;s guess .
nobody really knows what the internet is right now because it &apos;s different than it was an hour ago .
it &apos;s constantly changing . it &apos;s constantly reconfiguring .
and the problem with it is , i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that &apos;s basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller-scale system , and we &apos;ve kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate .
and so right now , i think it &apos;s literally true that we don &apos;t know what the consequences on the internet would be , and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year , and worse next year , and so on .
but so what we need is a plan b.
there is no plan b right now .
there &apos;s no clear backup system that we &apos;ve very carefully kept to be independent of the internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks .
so what we need is something that doesn &apos;t necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil .
this doesn &apos;t need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
it &apos;s actually relatively simple to do , technically , because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground , existing wireless infrastructure .
it &apos;s basically a matter of deciding to do it .
but people won &apos;t decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that &apos;s the problem that we have right now .
so there &apos;s been plenty of people , plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years , but it &apos;s very hard to get people focused on plan b when plan a seems to be working so well .
so i think that , if people understand how much we &apos;re starting to depend on the internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and i think if enough people say , &quot; yeah , i would like to use it , i &apos;d like to have such a system , &quot; then it will get built .
it &apos;s not that hard a problem .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you &apos;re going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix .
so i &apos;m happy to get a chance to tell you about it .
danny hillis : the internet could crash . we need a plan b
in the 1970s and 1980s , a generous spirit suffused the internet , whose users were few and far between . but today , the net is ubiquitous , connecting billions of people , machines and essential pieces of infrastructure -- leaving us vulnerable to cyber-attack or meltdown . internet pioneer danny hillis argues that the internet wasn &apos;t designed for this kind of scale , and sounds a clarion call for us to develop a plan b : a parallel system to fall back on if -- or when -- the internet crashes .
good afternoon .
many things have been said about this .
some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation -- and obviously , a quite mishandled one .
however , this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons .
it so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
they &apos;re of a new nature : they could lead the world into a digital conflict that could turn into an armed struggle .
these virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world .
in 1982 , in the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia , a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons , the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb .
now we know today -- this was revealed by thomas reed , ronald reagan &apos;s former u.s. air force secretary -- this explosion was actually the result of a cia sabotage operation , in which they had managed to infiltrate the it management systems of that pipeline .
more recently , the u.s. government revealed that in september 2008 , more than 3 million people in the state of espirito santo in brazil were plunged into darkness , victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates .
even more worrying for the americans , in december 2008 the holiest of holies , the it systems of centcom , the central command managing the wars in iraq and afghanistan , may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these : plain but infected usb keys .
and with these keys , they may have been able to get inside centcom &apos;s systems , to see and hear everything , and maybe even infect some of them .
as a result , the americans take the threat very seriously .
i &apos;ll quote general james cartwright , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , who says in a report to congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .
moreover , the americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .
and across the world today , we see a sort of cyber arms race , with cyberwar units built up by countries like north korea or even iran .
yet , what you &apos;ll never hear from spokespeople from the pentagon or the french department of defence is that the question isn &apos;t really who &apos;s the enemy , but actually the very nature of cyber weapons .
and to understand why , we must look at how , through the ages , military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace .
for example , if we &apos;d had tedxparis 350 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive vauban-style fortifications -- and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in europe .
which was indeed the case in europe between 1650 and 1750 .
similarly , if we &apos;d had this talk 30 or 40 years ago , we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons , and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply , prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers .
however , if we &apos;d had this talk 60 years ago , we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies , which give the advantage to the attacker , make the blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in europe .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cyber weapons .
okay , but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit ?
it gets even more complicated when the doctrines of use become ambiguous .
just 3 years ago , both the u.s. and france were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace , strictly to defend their it systems .
but today both countries say the best defense is to attack .
and so , they &apos;re joining china , whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been both defensive and offensive .
the second issue : your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness , and you may not even know who &apos;s attacking you .
cyber weapons have this peculiar feature : they can be used without leaving traces .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker , because the defender doesn &apos;t know who to fight back against .
and if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary , they risk making one more enemy and ending up diplomatically isolated .
this issue isn &apos;t just theoretical .
in may 2007 , estonia was the victim of cyberattacks , that damaged its communication and banking systems .
estonia accused russia .
but nato , though it defends estonia , reacted very prudently . why ?
because nato couldn &apos;t be 100 % sure that the kremlin was indeed behind these attacks .
so to sum up , on the one hand , when a possible enemy announces they &apos;re building a cyberwar unit , you don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s for attack or defense .
on the other hand , we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking .
in a major article published in 1978 , professor robert jervis of columbia university in new york described a model to understand how conflicts could arise .
in this context , when you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking , then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict .
this is the environment that &apos;s being created by cyber weapons today , and historically it was the environment in europe at the onset of world war i.
so cyber weapons are dangerous by nature , but in addition , they &apos;re emerging in a much more unstable environment .
if you remember the cold war , it was a very hard game , but a stable one played only by two players , which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers .
today we &apos;re moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at copenhagen .
why ? because no nation knows for sure whether its neighbor is about to attack .
so nations may live under the threat of what nobel prize winner thomas schelling called the &quot; reciprocal fear of surprise attack , &quot; as i don &apos;t know if my neighbor is about to attack me or not -- i may never know -- so i might take the upper hand and attack first .
just last week , in a new york times article dated january 26 , 2010 , it was revealed for the first time that officials at the national security agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the u.s. was about to be cyberattacked .
in may 2009 , general kevin chilton , commander of the u.s. nuclear forces , stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the u.s. , all options would be on the table .
cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons -- they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror .
but in doing so , they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict -- as we &apos;ve just seen , a very important risk -- and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us : european allies , nato members , our american friends and allies , our other western allies , and maybe , by forcing their hand a little , our russian and chinese partners .
the information technologies joël de rosnay was talking about , which were historically born from military research , are today on the verge of developing an offensive capability of destruction , which could tomorrow , if we &apos;re not careful , completely destroy world peace .
thank you .
guy-philippe goldstein : how cyberattacks threaten real-world peace
more and more , nations are waging attacks with cyber weapons -- silent strikes on another country &apos;s computer systems that leave behind no trace . guy-philippe goldstein shows how cyberattacks can leap between the digital and physical worlds to prompt armed conflict -- and how we might avert this global security hazard . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
cartoons are basically short stories .
i tried to find one that didn &apos;t have a whole lot of words .
not all of them have happy endings .
so how did i get started cartooning ?
i doodled a lot as a kid , and if you spend enough time doodling , sooner or later , something happens : all your career options run out .
so you have to make a living cartooning .
actually , i fell in love with the ocean when i was a little boy , when i was about eight or nine .
and i was particularly fascinated with sharks .
this is some of my early work .
eventually , my mom took the red crayon away , so it was &#91; unclear &#93; .
but i &apos;d like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently , and it &apos;s become the foundation of my work because , i feel like , if in a day , i can see the ocean differently , then i can evoke that same kind of change in others , especially kids .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
and this is how we &apos;ve seen the ocean since the beginning of time .
it &apos;s a mystery .
there &apos;s been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean , mostly negative .
and that prompted people to make maps like this , with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land , but when you get to the waters edge , the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint .
and this is the way i saw the ocean at school -- as if to say , &quot; all geography and science lessons stop at water &apos;s edge .
this part &apos;s not going to be on the test . &quot;
but that day i flew low over the islands -- it was a family trip to the caribbean , and i flew in a small plane low over the islands .
this is what i saw . i saw hills and valleys .
i saw forests and meadows .
i saw grottoes and secret gardens and places i &apos;d love to hide as a kid , if i could only breathe underwater .
and best of all , i saw the animals .
i saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane i was flying in .
and i flew over a lagoon with a shark in it , and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born .
so from that day on , i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land , but my head was down there , underwater .
up until that day , these were the animals that were most common in my life .
these were the ones i &apos;d like to draw -- all variations of four legs and fur .
but when you got to the ocean , my imagination was no competition for nature .
every time i &apos;d come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board , i &apos;d find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier .
and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie .
whenever i talk to kids , i always like to tell them , the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive .
it &apos;s not a dinosaur ; it &apos;s a whale , animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
so you have living dinosaurs and space aliens , animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions .
it &apos;s just incredible ; no hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that .
or this fangtooth . the particles in the water make it look like it &apos;s floating in outer space .
could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that ?
it would start a whole new space race .
but instead , we stick a camera in the deep ocean , and we see a fish , and it doesn &apos;t capture our imagination as a society .
we say to ourselves , &quot; maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something . &quot;
so , what i &apos;d like to do now is try a little drawing .
i love to draw the deep sea fish , because they are so ugly , but beautiful in their own way .
maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here -- give him a headlight , maybe a brake light , turn signals .
but it &apos;s easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters , their shapes and sizes .
so some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book .
for instance , take these sea turtles .
they kind of have a sixth sense like superman &apos;s x-ray vision .
they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth .
and they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean .
i kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with .
or take this sea cucumber .
it &apos;s not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all .
he &apos;s like an underwater spiderman .
he shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy .
of course , sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a superhero .
or the blowfish .
the blowfish is like the incredible hulk .
it can change its body into a big , intimidating fish in a matter of seconds .
i &apos;m going to draw this blowfish uninflated .
and then i &apos;m going to attempt onscreen animation here .
let &apos;s see .
try and inflate it .
&quot; you talkin &apos; to me ? &quot; see , he can inflate himself when he wants to be intimidating .
or take this swordfish .
could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose ?
do you think he wakes up in the morning , looks in the mirror and says , &quot; somebody &apos;s getting stabbed today . &quot;
or this lionfish for instance .
it &apos;s not something you want to put on your facebook page , right ?
my characters are -- my lead character &apos;s a shark named sherman .
he &apos;s a great white shark .
and i kind of broke the mold with sherman .
i didn &apos;t want to go with this ruthless predator image .
he &apos;s kind of just out there making a living .
he &apos;s sort of a homer simpson with fins .
and then his sidekick is a sea turtle , as i mentioned before , named filmore .
he uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans , looking for a mate .
and he does manage to find them , but great navigation skills , lousy pick-up lines .
i have a hermit crab named hawthorne , who doesn &apos;t get a lot of respect as a hermit crab , so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark .
and then i &apos;ll introduce you to one more character , this guy , ernest , who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body .
so with characters , you can make stories .
sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens .
so , imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom .
or , sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they &apos;re underwater .
for instance , i took them skiing in the mid-atlantic range , which is this range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic .
i &apos;ve taken them to the sea of japan , where they met giant jellyfish .
i &apos;ve taken them camping in the kelp forests of california .
this next one here , i did a story on the census of marine life .
and that was a lot of fun because , as most of you know , it &apos;s a real project we &apos;ve heard about .
but it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters .
so we start off the story with ernest , who volunteers as a census taker .
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .
then he meets the yeti crab , the famous vampire squid -- elusive , hard to find -- and the dumbo octopus , which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn &apos;t have to change a thing when i drew it .
i did another story on marine debris .
i was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business , and they -- i asked them , &quot; so what &apos;s one issue you would like everyone to know more about ? &quot;
and they said -- this one friend of mine said , &quot; i &apos;ve got one word for you : plastic . &quot;
and i told him , &quot; well , i need something a little sexier than that .
plastic just is not going to do it . &quot;
he wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride , which doesn &apos;t really work in voice balloons very well .
i couldn &apos;t fit them in .
basically , this bottle travels a long way .
what i &apos;m trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn &apos;t really go away ; it just continues to wash downstream .
and a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean , which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it , especially if they can &apos;t stand each other , like these two .
so , i sent them to boise , idaho , where they dropped a plastic bottle into the boise sewer system .
and it ended up in the boise river and then on to the columbia river and then to the mouth of the columbia and to the pacific ocean and then on to this place called the great pacific garbage patch -- which is this giant pacific gyre in the north pacific , where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around -- and then back onto the lagoon .
so that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along .
so a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway , but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one .
the third storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .
it was on shark finning , and i felt really strongly about this issue .
and i felt like , since my main character was a shark , the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this .
now , finning is the act of taking a shark , cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water .
it &apos;s cruel , it &apos;s wasteful .
there &apos;s nothing funny or entertaining about it , but i really wanted to take this issue on .
i had to kill my main character , who is a shark .
we start with sherman in a chinese restaurant , who gets a fortune that he &apos;s about to get caught by a trawler , which he does .
and then he dies .
he gets finned , and then he gets thrown overboard .
ostensibly , he &apos;s dead now .
and so i killed a character that &apos;s been in the newspaper for 15 years .
meanwhile , the other characters are talking about shark fin soup .
i do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue .
sherman &apos;s up in shark heaven .
you really don &apos;t have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because , if you start with a talking shark , readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door .
you can kind of do anything .
it becomes a near-death experience for sherman .
meanwhile , ernest finds his fins on the internet .
there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins , so i kind of exposed that .
and he clicks the &quot; buy now &quot; button .
and voila , next-day air , they show up , and they surgically reattach them .
i ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition that encouraged our national marine fishery service , to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management .
thanks .
i &apos;d like to end with a little metaphor here .
i &apos;ve been trying to think of a metaphor to represent mission blue , and this is what i came up with .
imagine you &apos;re in an enormous room , and it &apos;s as dark as a cave .
and you can have anything in that room , anything you want , but you can &apos;t see anything .
you &apos;ve been given one tool , a hammer .
so you wander around in the darkness , and you bump into something , and it feels like it &apos;s made of stone .
it &apos;s big , it &apos;s heavy . you can &apos;t carry it away , so you bang it with your hammer , and you break off a piece .
and you take the piece out into the daylight .
and you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster .
so you say to yourself , &quot; well , that &apos;s worth something . &quot;
so you go back into the room , and you break this thing to pieces , and you haul it away .
and you find other things , and you break that up , and you haul those away .
and you &apos;re getting all kinds of cool stuff .
so you get this sense of urgency , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible .
and then some yells , &quot; stop ! &quot;
and they turn up the lights .
and you realize where you are ; you &apos;re in the louvre .
and you &apos;ve taken all this complexity and beauty , and you &apos;ve turned it into a cheap commodity .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with the ocean .
and part of what mission blue is about is yelling , &quot; stop ! &quot;
so that each of us -- explorer , scientist , cartoonist , singer , chef -- can turn up the lights in their own way .
and that &apos;s what i hope my comic strip does in a small way .
that &apos;s why i like what i do .
jim toomey : learning from sherman the shark
cartoonist jim toomey created the comic strip sherman &apos;s lagoon , a wry look at underwater life starring sherman the talking shark . as he sketches some of his favorite sea creatures live onstage , toomey shares his love of the ocean and the stories it can tell .
this is not a story of tibet and it &apos;s not a story of the amazon .
i won &apos;t be taking you to the high arctic , the life of the inuit , or to the searing sands of the sahara .
this is actually a story of my own backyard .
it &apos;s a land known to the tahltan people and all the first nations of british columbia as the sacred headwaters , the source of the three great salmon rivers of home , the skeena , the stikine and the nass .
it &apos;s a valley where , in a long day , perhaps , too , you can follow the tracks of grizzly and wolf and drink from the very sources of water that gave rise and cradled the great civilizations of the northwest coast .
it &apos;s such a beautiful place . it &apos;s the most stunningly wild place i &apos;ve ever been .
it &apos;s the sort of place that we , as canadians , could throw england , and they &apos;d never find it .
john muir , in 1879 , went up just the lower third of the stikine , and he was so enraptured he called it a yosemite 150 miles long .
he came back to california and named his dog after that river of enchantment .
in the lower 48 , the farthest you can get away from a maintained road is 20 miles .
i followed that road in the early 1970s , soon after it was built , to take a job as the first park ranger in spatsizi wilderness .
my job description was deliciously vague : wilderness assessment and public relations .
in two four-month seasons i saw not a dozen people .
there was no one to relate publicly to .
but in the course of these wanderings , i came upon an old shaman &apos;s grave that led to an encounter with a remarkable man : alex jack , an gitxsan elder and chief who had lived as a trapper and a hunter in that country for all of his life .
and over the course of 30 years , i recorded traditional tales from alex , mostly mythological accounts of wy-ghet , the trickster transformer of gitxsan lore who , in his folly , taught the people how to live on the land .
and just before alex died at the age of 96 , he gave me a gift .
it was a tool carved from caribou bone by his grandfather in 1910 , and it turned out to be a specialized implement used by a trapper to skin out the eyelids of wolves .
it was only when alex passed away that i realized that the eyelids , in some sense , were my own , and having done so much to allow me to learn to see , alex in his own way was saying goodbye .
well , isolation has been the great saving grace of this remarkable place , but today isolation could be its doom .
you &apos;ve heard so much about the developments of the tar sands , the controversy about the keystone and the enbridge pipelines , but these are just elements of a tsunami of industrial development that is sweeping across all of the wild country of northern canada .
in tahltan territory alone , there are 41 major industrial proposals , some with great promise , some of great concern .
on todagin mountain , revered by the tahltan people as a wildlife sanctuary in the sky , home to the largest population of stone sheep on the planet , imperial metals -- but the 75th-biggest mining company in all of canada -- has secured permits to establish an open-pit copper and gold mine which will process 30,000 tons of rock a day for 30 years , generating hundreds of millions of tons of toxic waste that , by the project &apos;s design , will simply be dumped into the lakes of the sacred headwaters .
at the headwaters itself , shell canada has plans to extract methane gas from coal seams that underly a million acres , fracking the coal with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic chemicals , establishing perhaps as many as 6,000 wellheads , and eventually a network of roads and pipelines and flaring wellheads , all to generate methane gas that most likely will go east to fuel the expansion of the tar sands .
for over a decade , the tahltan people , both clans , wolf and crow , have resisted this assault on their homeland .
men , women and children of all ages , elders in wheelchairs , have blockaded the only road access to the interior .
for them , the headwaters is a kitchen .
it &apos;s a sanctuary . it &apos;s a burial ground of their ancestors .
and those who really own it are the generations as yet unborn .
the tahltan have been able , with the support of all canadians who live downstream , all local politicians , to resist this assault on their homeland , but now everything hangs in the balance .
decisions that will be made this year will literally determine the fate of this country .
the tahltan have called for the creation of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside the largest protected area in british columbia .
the tahltan need your help . we need your help .
and if any of you would like to join us on this great adventure , please come and see me later today .
wade davis : gorgeous photos of a backyard wilderness worth saving
ethnographer wade davis explores hidden places in the wider world -- but in this powerful short talk he urges us to save a paradise in his backyard , northern canada . the sacred headwaters , remote and pristine , are under threat because they hide rich tar sands . with stunning photos , davis asks a tough question : how can we balance society &apos;s need for fuels with the urge to protect such glorious wilderness ?
well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
my name is art benjamin , and i am a &quot; mathemagician . &quot;
what that means is , i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call &quot; mathemagics . &quot;
but before i get started , i have a quick question for the audience .
seriously , if you have a calculator with you , raise your hand , raise your hand .
i -- was -- your hand go up ?
now bring it out , bring it out . anybody else ?
i see , i see one way in the back .
you sir , that &apos;s three , and anybody on this side here ?
ok , you over there on the aisle . would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators , then join me up on stage .
and let &apos;s give these volunteers a nice round of applause .
that &apos;s right . now , since i haven &apos;t had the chance to work with these calculators , i need to make sure that they are all working properly .
would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please ?
how about a two-digit number ?
audience : 22 .
arthur benjamin : 22 . and another two-digit number , sir ?
audience : 47 .
multiply 22 times 47 , make sure you get 1,034 , or the calculators are not working . do all of you get 1,034 ? 1,034 ?
would you like to try a more standard calculator , just in case ?
ok , great .
what i &apos;m going to try and do then -- i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .
that &apos;s ok . i &apos;ll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator .
there is something called the square of a number , which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself .
for instance , five squared would be ?
audience : 25 .
25 . now , the way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number , such as five , hitting &quot; times &quot; and then &quot; equals , &quot; and on most calculators that will give you the square .
on some of these ancient rpn calculators , you &apos;ve got an &quot; x squared &quot; button on it , will allow you to do the calculation even faster .
what i &apos;m going to try and do now is to square , in my head , four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators , even using the shortcut method .
what i &apos;ll use is the second row this time , and i &apos;ll get four of you -- one , two , three , four -- to each yell out a two-digit number , and if you would square the first number , and if you would square the second , the third and the fourth , i will try and race you to the answer . ok ?
so quickly , a two-digit number please .
audience : 37 .
37 squared , ok .
audience : 23 .
23 squared , ok .
audience : 59 .
59 squared , ok , and finally ?
audience : 93 .
93 squared . would you call out your answers , please ?
1369 . 1369 .
529 .
3481 .
8649 .
let me try to take this one step further .
i won &apos;t even write these down -- i &apos;ll just call them out as they &apos;re called out to me .
anyone i point to , call out a three-digit number .
anyone on our panel , verify the answer .
just give some indication if it &apos;s right .
a three-digit number , sir , yes ?
audience : 987 .
987 squared is 974,169 .
yes ? good .
another , another three-digit -- -- another three-digit number , sir ?
audience : 457 .
457 squared is 205,849 .
205,849 ?
yes ?
ok , another , another three-digit number , sir ?
audience : 321 .
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
yes ? one more three-digit number please .
audience : oh , 722 .
722 is 500 -- ooh , that &apos;s a harder one .
yes ? oh , one more , one more three-digit number please .
audience : 162 .
162 squared is 26,244 .
let me try to take this one step further .
now you can all take your time on this ; i will not beat you to the answer on this one , but i will try to get the answer right .
to make this a little bit more random , let &apos;s take the fourth row this time , let &apos;s say , one , two , three , four .
if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine , that will be the four-digit number that i &apos;ll square .
audience : nine .
audience : seven . seven .
audience : five . five .
audience : eight . eight .
9,758 , this will take me a little bit of time , so bear with me .
95,218,564 ?
now , i would attempt to square a five-digit number -- and i can -- but unfortunately most calculators cannot .
eight-digit capacity -- don &apos;t you hate that ?
so , since we &apos;ve reached the limits of our calculators -- what &apos;s that ? does yours go -- i don &apos;t know .
does yours go higher ?
oh -- yours does ?
i can probably do it .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
in the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .
let &apos;s take the largest number on the board here , 8649 .
and instead of squaring it this time , i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want , but don &apos;t tell me what you &apos;re multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number .
so you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number .
how many digits do you have , six or seven ?
seven , and yours ? seven .
seven ? seven ?
and , uncertain .
yeah .
seven . is there any possible way that i could know what seven digit numbers you have ? say &quot; no . &quot;
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
one digit at a time , i shall try and determine the digit you &apos;ve left out .
so , starting with your seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
one , ok , 197042 .
did you leave out the number 6 ?
yes , good , ok , that &apos;s one .
you have a seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
i think i only heard five numbers . i -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6 ?
yes . same as she did , ok . you &apos;ve got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear .
079044 .
i think you left out the number 3 ?
that &apos;s three . the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000 : 10 to the fourth power .
ok , any six of them .
really scramble them up this time , please .
did you leave out the number 7 ?
for my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries , i have one more question for the audience .
by any chance , does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on ?
if you think you know your birth day , raise your hand .
let &apos;s see , starting with -- let &apos;s start with a gentleman first , ok sir , what year was it , first of all ? that &apos;s why i start with a gentleman first .
what year ?
audience : 1953 .
1953 , and the month ?
audience : november . november what ?
audience : 23rd .
23rd -- was that a monday ? audience : yes .
yes , good . somebody else ? who else would like -- see i don &apos;t -- haven &apos;t seen any women &apos;s hands up .
ok , it &apos;s -- how about you , what year ?
audience : 1949 . 1949 , and the month ?
audience : october . october what ?
audience : fifth .
fifth -- was that a wednesday ?
yes , my -- i &apos;ll go way to the back right now , how about you ?
yell it out , what year ? audience : 1959 .
1959 , ok -- and the month ?
audience : february .
february what ? audience : sixth .
good , how about the person behind her ?
call -- call -- what year was it ?
audience : 1947 . 1947 , and the month ?
audience : may . may what ?
audience : seventh . seventh -- would that be a wednesday ?
audience : yes .
anybody here who &apos;d like to know the day of the week they were born ?
we can do it that way .
of course , i could just make up an answer and you wouldn &apos;t know , so i come prepared for that .
i brought with me a book of calendars .
i didn &apos;t mean to look at you , sir -- you were just sitting there .
anyway , chris , you can help me out here , if you wouldn &apos;t mind .
this is a book of calendars , and i &apos;ll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ? you sir ? ok .
what year was it , first of all ?
audience : 1966 .
&apos;66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month ?
audience : april . april what ?
audience : 17th . 17th -- i believe that was a sunday .
can you confirm , chris ?
yes . yeah , ok . i &apos;ll tell you what , chris : as long as you have that book in front of you , do me a favor , turn to a year outside of the 1900s , either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that &apos;ll be a much greater challenge for me .
what year , chris , would you like ?
1824 .
and what month ? june .
june what ? sixth .
sixth -- was that a sunday ?
it was . and it was cloudy .
good , thank you very much .
but i &apos;d like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation .
there was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator .
where is he , would you stand up , 10-digit guy ?
ok , well stand up for me just for a second , so i can see where you are .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ?
ok , what i &apos;m going to try and do , is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator .
but to make my job more interesting for you , as well as for me , i &apos;m going to do this problem thinking out loud .
so you can actually , honestly hear what &apos;s going on in my mind while i do a calculation of this size .
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
i know as a magician we &apos;re not supposed to reveal our secrets , but i &apos;m not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week , so -- i think we &apos;re ok .
so , let &apos;s see , let &apos;s take a -- let &apos;s take a different row of people , starting with you .
i &apos;ll get five digits : one , two , three , four -- oh , i did this row already . let &apos;s do the row before you , starting with you sir : one , two , three , four , five .
call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that i will try to square . go ahead .
audience : five . five .
audience : seven . seven .
audience : six . six .
audience : eight . eight .
57,683 squared . yuck .
let me explain to you how i &apos;m going to attempt this problem .
i &apos;m going to break the problem down into three parts .
i &apos;ll do 57,000 squared , plus 683 squared , plus 57,000 times 683 times two .
add all those numbers together , and with any luck , arrive at the answer .
now , let me recap .
thank you .
while i explain something else -- -- i know , that you can use , right ?
while i do these calculation &#91; s &#93; , you might hear certain words , as opposed to numbers , creep into the calculation .
let me explain what that is .
this is a phonetic code , a mnemonic device that i use , that allows me to convert numbers into words .
i store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
i know it sounds complicated ; it &apos;s not -- i just don &apos;t want you to think you &apos;re seeing something out of &quot; rain man &quot; here .
there &apos;s definitely a method to my madness -- definitely , definitely . sorry .
if you want to talk to me about adhd afterwards , you can talk to me then . all right -- by the way , one last instruction , for my judges with the calculators -- ok , you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that i will make a mistake here .
if i do , don &apos;t tell me what the mistake is ; just say , &quot; you &apos;re close , &quot; or something like that , and i &apos;ll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself .
if , however , i am right , whatever you do , don &apos;t keep it to yourself , ok ?
make sure everybody knows that i got the answer right , because this is my big finish , ok .
so , without any more stalling , here we go .
i &apos;ll start the problem in the middle , with 57 times 683 .
now , 57 times 68 is 3,400 , plus 476 is 3876 , that &apos;s 38,760 plus 171 , 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931 .
38,931 ; double that to get 77,862 .
that seems right , i &apos;ll go on . cookie fission , ok .
next , i do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , so i can say , three billion . take the 249 , add that to cookie , 249 , oops , but i see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie , 250 plus 77 , is 327 million -- fission , fission , ok , finally , we do 683 squared , that &apos;s 700 times 666 , plus 17 squared is 466,489 , rev up if i need it , rev up , take the 466 , add that to fission , to get , oh gee -- 328,489 .
audience : yeah !
good .
i hope you enjoyed mathemagics . thank you .
arthur benjamin : a performance of &quot; mathemagic &quot;
in a lively show , mathemagician arthur benjamin races a team of calculators to figure out 3-digit squares , solves another massive mental equation and guesses a few birthdays . how does he do it ? he &apos;ll tell you .
i &apos;m delighted to be here .
i &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
i would love to talk about stuff that i &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , i suspect that what i &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
first off , my badge says i &apos;m an astronomer .
i would love to talk about my astronomy , but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
so i &apos;m not going to talk about that .
it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at lawrence berkeley labs .
and i caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb , and stealing information and selling it .
and i &apos;d love to talk about that -- and it &apos;d be fun -- but , 20 years later ...
i find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
it &apos;s tedious .
i &apos;m -- the first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
the second time , it &apos;s engineering .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
i &apos;m a scientist . once i do something , i do something else .
i feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
my idea is : no ! no !
get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
and i &apos;d love to talk about this , but i think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about -- but i guess i may be very wrong about that , and everything else that i &apos;ve said .
so don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
it probably has lies in it as well .
having said that , i outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
and if you look at it over here , the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future .
i &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
oh , right . and my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because i &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
in fact , i think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
no ! don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
no , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
they know .
in fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
they &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
i don &apos;t . nor , i suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
but to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
what i ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m going to talk about .
oh -- the other thing that i think i &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . right over here .
is that visible ? what i &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
because i love mobius loops . i not only love mobius loops , but i &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes klein bottles .
right away , i hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
this is a klein bottle .
for those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , i know all about it .
it &apos;s one sided . it &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
it has zero volume . and it &apos;s non-orientable .
it has wonderful properties .
if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and i make them out of glass .
and i &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but i don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because -- however , the &quot; d &quot; in ted of course stands for design .
just two weeks ago i made -- you know , i &apos;ve been making small , medium and big klein bottles for the trade .
but what i &apos;ve just made -- and i &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
this is a klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
so it &apos;s highly -- that one &apos;s the cool one .
that was a month of my life .
but although i would love to talk about topology with you , i &apos;m not going to .
instead , i &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
could somebody put this guy up ?
and i looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when i was working at the electronic music studio !
as a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at suny buffalo . and wow !
way back machine . and i said to myself , oh yeah !
and it sent me back .
soon after that , i found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
this guy over here of course is me .
this man is robert moog , the inventor of the moog synthesizer , who passed away this past august .
robert moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
a musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at suny buffalo .
he &apos;d come up from trumansburg to teach me not just about the moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there -- i &apos;m studying physics at the time . this is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
we &apos;re studying physics , i &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; that &apos;s a good thing to do .
don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot;
mentoring me . he &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
in the background , my bicycle .
i realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
bob moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show greg flint and i things about this .
we sat around talking about fourier transforms , bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .
oh , cool . i can get to this place over here , right ?
i &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , i don &apos;t have a big enough head .
so i think locally and i act locally .
i feel that the best way i can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
so ph.d. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
i was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
and one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;ve taught graduate -- i &apos;ve had graduate students , i &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot;
no , they said , &quot; if you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
put your money where you mouth is . &quot;
is true . is true . i teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
not just showing up every now and then .
no , no , no , no , no . i take attendance .
i take lunch hour .
this is not -- no , no , no , this is not claps .
i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
not just show up to class every now and then .
teach a solid week . okay , i &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
one of the things that i &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
no calculus , i &apos;ll cut out that .
you won &apos;t need to know trig .
but you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
we &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot;
oh , before i even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class -- this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
my students in el cerrito -- with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope -- measured the speed of light .
we were off by 25 percent . how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
i &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
i was all set to do it and i was thinking , &quot; aw man , &quot; i was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
and i &apos;m all set to do it . i &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
and there &apos;s no time to do it .
so , next time , maybe , i &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
but meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
but , probably -- one of my students , ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
is a constant . when the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . so , if we have a wave here -- over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting -- as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
right ? this is simple physics .
all of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
what they didn &apos;t tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics -- but they should have , and i wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
and that constant is the speed of sound .
so , in order to measure the speed of sound , all i &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . well , that &apos;s easy .
i &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
set it up to around a , above a , above a. there &apos;s an a , more or less .
now , so i know the frequency .
it &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . i measure its wavelength .
so anytime i talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
i &apos;ll put it over here , and as i move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
the slinky moves . we &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
those of you who are physicists , i hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me .
to measure the wavelength , all i need to do is measure the distance from here -- one full wave -- over to here .
from here to here is the wavelength of sound .
so , i &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
i &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
ok , let &apos;s go back to mr. elmo .
and we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
the wavelength was 0.2 meters .
let &apos;s figure out what this is .
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
if you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
but , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink -- we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to -- not bad . pretty good .
all of which comes to what i wanted to say .
go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
it was 1971 , the vietnam war was going on , and i &apos;m like , &quot; oh my god ! &quot;
i &apos;m studying physics : landau , lipschitz , resnick and halliday .
i &apos;m going home for a midterm . a riot &apos;s going on on campus .
there &apos;s a riot ! hey , elmo &apos;s done : off .
i &apos;m walking across campus . cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; you ! you &apos;re a student . &quot;
pulls out a gun . goes boom !
and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi can goes by my head . whoosh !
i get a breath of tear gas and i can &apos;t breathe .
this cop comes after me with a rifle .
he wants to clunk me over the head !
i &apos;m saying , &quot; i got to clear out of here ! &quot;
i go running across campus quick as i can . i duck into hayes hall .
it &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
the cop &apos;s chasing me .
chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
chases me into this room .
the entranceway to the bell tower .
i slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking .
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot;
i go to a place where a dowel splits off .
there &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
the time &apos;s going backwards because i &apos;m inside of it .
i &apos;m thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity .
i climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
i pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
a dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
and i &apos;m asking , &quot; what am i doing here ? why am i here ? &quot;
then i remember what my english teacher in high school said .
namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
so , i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and i look at it .
i &apos;m asking myself , &quot; why am i here ? &quot;
so , at this time , i &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells : &quot; all truth is one .
in this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
it is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot;
clifford stoll : the call to learn
clifford stoll captivates his audience with a wildly energetic sprinkling of anecdotes , observations , asides -- and even a science experiment . after all , by his own definition , he &apos;s a scientist : &quot; once i do something , i want to do something else . &quot;
what &apos;s in the box ?
whatever it is must be pretty important , because i &apos;ve traveled with it , moved it , from apartment to apartment to apartment .
did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
three times .
so you &apos;d think , with all this extra space , we &apos;d have plenty of room for all our stuff .
nope .
there &apos;s a new industry in town , a 22 billion-dollar , 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry : that of personal storage .
so we &apos;ve got triple the space , but we &apos;ve become such good shoppers that we need even more space .
so where does this lead ?
lots of credit card debt , huge environmental footprints , and perhaps not coincidentally , our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college -- in your dorm , traveling -- in a hotel room , camping -- rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
so i &apos;m going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
it &apos;s actually a great way to save you some money .
and it &apos;s going to give you a little more ease in your life .
so i started a project called life edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
first up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto.com.
i wanted it all -- home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
with over 300 entries from around the world , i got it , my own little jewel box .
instead of 600 , immediately i &apos;m saving 200 grand .
smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities -- save some more money there , but also a smaller footprint .
and because it &apos;s really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me , i &apos;m really excited to be there .
so how can you live little ?
three main approaches .
we &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
and that shirt that i hadn &apos;t worn in years ?
it &apos;s time for me to let it go .
we &apos;ve got to cut the extraneous out of our lives , and we &apos;ve got to learn to stem the inflow .
we need to think before we buy .
ask ourselves , &quot; is that really going to make me happier ? truly ? &quot;
by all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
but we want stuff that we &apos;re going to love for years , not just stuff .
secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
we want space efficiency .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
you can take paperwork , books , movies , and you can make it disappear -- it &apos;s magic .
finally , we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet , a dining table becomes a bed -- same space , a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .
in the winning life edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10 .
my office folds away , easily hidden .
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
guests ? move the moving wall , have some fold-down guest beds .
and of course , my own movie theater .
so i &apos;m not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft .
but consider the benefits of an edited life .
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room .
so when you go home and you walk through your front door , take a second and ask yourselves , &quot; could i do with a little life editing ?
would that give me a little more freedom ?
maybe a little more time ? &quot;
what &apos;s in the box ?
it doesn &apos;t really matter .
i know i don &apos;t need it .
what &apos;s in yours ?
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
so let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
graham hill : less stuff , more happiness
writer and designer graham hill asks : can having less stuff , in less room , lead to more happiness ? he makes the case for taking up less space , and lays out three rules for editing your life .
so , here we go : a flyby of play .
it &apos;s got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february 17th sunday magazine about play .
at the bottom of this , it says , &quot; it &apos;s deeper than gender .
seriously , but dangerously fun .
and a sandbox for new ideas about evolution . &quot;
not bad , except if you look at that cover , what &apos;s missing ?
you see any adults ?
well , lets go back to the 15th century .
this is a courtyard in europe , and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play .
all ages , solo play , body play , games , taunting .
i think we may have lost something in our culture .
so i &apos;m gonna take you through what i think is a remarkable sequence .
north of churchill , manitoba , in october and november , there &apos;s no ice on hudson bay .
and this polar bear that you see , this 1200-pound male , he &apos;s wild and fairly hungry .
and norbert rosing , a german photographer , is there on scene , making a series of photos of these huskies , who are tethered .
any of you who &apos;ve been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you , there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you &apos;re in trouble .
but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow , wagging her tail .
and something very unusual happens .
that fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal -- changes .
and this polar bear stands over the husky , no claws extended , no fangs taking a look .
a play ballet .
this is in nature : it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death .
and if you &apos;ll begin to look closely at the husky that &apos;s bearing her throat to the polar bear , and look a little more closely , they &apos;re in an altered state .
they &apos;re in a state of play .
and it &apos;s that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .
they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .
and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that &apos;s within all of us .
now how did i get involved in this ?
john mentioned that i &apos;ve done some work with murderers , and i have .
the texas tower murderer opened my eyes , in retrospect , when we studied his tragic mass murder , to the importance of play , in that that individual , by deep study , was found to have severe play deprivation .
charles whitman was his name .
and our committee , which consisted of a lot of hard scientists , did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated .
and that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times , at virginia tech .
and other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play , but i didn &apos;t really understand what it was .
and it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before i really began to recognize that i didn &apos;t really have a full understanding of it .
and i don &apos;t think any of us has a full understanding of it , by any means .
but there are ways of looking at it that i think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy , a way of thinking about it .
and this image is , for humans , the beginning point of play .
when that mother and infant lock eyes , and the infant &apos;s old enough to have a social smile , what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother .
and she begins to babble and coo and smile , and so does the baby .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electroencephalogram , the right brain of each of them becomes attuned , so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a handle on .
and i &apos;d like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans .
we &apos;re going to look at body play , which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .
this is a mountain goat .
if you &apos;re having a bad day , try this : jump up and down , wiggle around -- you &apos;re going to feel better .
and you may feel like this character , who is also just doing it for its own sake .
it doesn &apos;t have a particular purpose , and that &apos;s what &apos;s great about play .
if its purpose is more important than the act of doing it , it &apos;s probably not play .
and there &apos;s a whole other type of play , which is object play .
and this japanese macaque has made a snowball , and he or she &apos;s going to roll down a hill .
and -- they don &apos;t throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being playful .
the human hand , in manipulation of objects , is the hand in search of a brain ; the brain is in search of a hand ; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way .
jpl we heard this morning -- jpl is an incredible place .
they have located two consultants , frank wilson and nate johnson , who are -- frank wilson is a neurologist , nate johnson is a mechanic .
he taught mechanics in a high school in long beach , and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems .
and he tried to figure out why . and he came to the conclusion , quite on his own , that the students who could no longer solve problems , such as fixing cars , hadn &apos;t worked with their hands .
frank wilson had written a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
they got together -- jpl hired them .
now jpl , nasa and boeing , before they will hire a research and development problem solver -- even if they &apos;re summa cum laude from harvard or cal tech -- if they haven &apos;t fixed cars , haven &apos;t done stuff with their hands early in life , played with their hands , they can &apos;t problem-solve as well .
so play is practical , and it &apos;s very important .
now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration .
but it has to be safe exploration .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an anatomically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
but curiosity , exploration , are part of the play scene .
and social play is part of what we &apos;re about here today , and is a byproduct of the play scene .
these lionesses , seen from a distance , looked like they were fighting .
but if you look closely , they &apos;re kind of like the polar bear and husky : no claws , flat fur , soft eyes , open mouth with no fangs , balletic movements , curvilinear movements -- all specific to play .
and rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
spectator play , ritual play -- we &apos;re involved in some of that .
those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment -- rare -- where the red sox won the world series .
but take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture , and you can get a sense that they &apos;re all at play .
imaginative play .
i love this picture because my daughter , who &apos;s now almost 40 , is in this picture , but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination , her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool .
a really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play .
and i love this one , because it &apos;s also what we &apos;re about .
we all have an internal narrative that &apos;s our own inner story .
the unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story .
i &apos;m telling you a story today about play .
well , this bushman , i think , is talking about the fish that got away that was that long , but it &apos;s a fundamental part of the play scene .
so what does play do for the brain ?
well , a lot .
we don &apos;t know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain , because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .
i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant .
they &apos;d given me a large grant when i was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
i think that -- that &apos;s a few years back -- i think that wave is past , and the play wave is cresting , because there is some good science .
three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum , puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe -- the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed , and -- and , and , and .
so it &apos;s -- for me , its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that &apos;s associated with play , and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn &apos;t really thought of it that way .
and that &apos;s part of what the national institute for play is all about .
and this is one of the ways you can study play -- is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have a playful-looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
and we &apos;ve got a mother-infant play scenario that we &apos;re hoping to complete underway at the moment .
the animal world has objectified it .
in the animal world , if you take rats , who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak , they wrestle , they pin each other , that &apos;s part of their play .
if you stop that behavior on one group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and you allow it in another group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar , they &apos;re hardwired to flee and hide .
pretty smart -- they don &apos;t want to get killed by a cat .
so what happens ?
they both hide out .
the non-players never come out -- they die .
the players slowly explore the environment , and begin again to test things out .
that says to me , at least in rats -- and i think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture -- that play may be pretty important for our survival .
and , and , and -- there are a lot more animal studies that i could talk about .
now , this is a consequence of play deprivation .
this took a long time -- i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and multiple eegs , but as a couch potato , his brain has shrunk .
and we do know that in domestic animals and others , when they &apos;re play deprived , they don &apos;t -- and rats also -- they don &apos;t develop a brain that is normal .
now , the program says that the opposite of play is not work , it &apos;s depression .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no flirtation , no movies , no games , no fantasy and , and , and .
try and imagine a culture or a life , adult or otherwise without play .
and we all have capacity to play signal .
nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .
what &apos;s going to follow from that behavior is play .
and you can trust it .
the basis of human trust is established through play signals .
and we begin to lose those signals , culturally and otherwise , as adults .
that &apos;s a shame .
i think we &apos;ve got a lot of learning to do .
now , jane goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps .
so part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal , facial , body , gestural .
you know , you can tell -- and i think when we &apos;re getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
you may not know this word , but it should be your biological first name and last name .
because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood .
and we are , by physical anthropologists , by many , many studies , the most neotenous , the most youthful , the most flexible , the most plastic of all creatures .
and therefore , the most playful .
and this gives us a leg up on adaptability .
now , there is a way of looking at play that i also want to emphasize here , which is the play history .
your own personal play history is unique , and often is not something we think about particularly .
this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll .
kevin carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances : alcoholic mother , absent father , inner-city philadelphia , black , had to take care of a younger brother .
found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined , he felt something different .
and so he followed up on it .
and he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life .
now there &apos;s another play history that i think is a work in progress .
those of you who remember al gore , during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency , may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person , at least in public .
and looking at his history , which is common in the press , it seems to me , at least -- looking at it from a shrink &apos;s point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed .
summers were hard , hard work , in the heat of tennessee summers .
and although i think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because i do know something about that -- he wasn &apos;t as empowered , i think , as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive , which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history .
so what i would encourage on an individual level to do , is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear , joyful , playful image that you have , whether it &apos;s with a toy , on a birthday or on a vacation .
and begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now .
and you &apos;ll find , you may change jobs -- which has happened to a number people when i &apos;ve had them do this -- in order to be more empowered through their play .
or you &apos;ll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it .
most of us work with groups , and i put this up because the d.school , the design school at stanford , thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment , has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called &quot; from play to innovation . &quot;
and you &apos;ll see this course is to investigate the human state of play , which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state and its importance to creative thinking : &quot; to explore play behavior , its development and its biological basis ; to apply those principles , through design thinking , to promote innovation in the corporate world ; and the students will work with real-world partners on design projects with widespread application . &quot;
this is our maiden voyage in this .
we &apos;re about two and a half , three months into it , and it &apos;s really been fun .
there is our star pupil , this labrador , who taught a lot of us what a state of play is , and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there .
and brendan boyle , rich crandall -- and on the far right is , i think , a person who will be in cahoots with george smoot for a nobel prize -- stuart thompson , in neuroscience .
so we &apos;ve had brendan , who &apos;s from ideo , and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom .
and one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring , and to try and do something about it .
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that .
flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing .
characterized by a feeling of energized focus , full involvement and success in the process of the activity .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be that way .
some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it &apos;s over .
take the meeting off , and have peace of mind that you can come back to me .
because when you need it again , the meeting is literally hanging in your closet .
the wearable meeting .
because when you put it on , you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting .
but when you take it off -- that &apos;s when the real action happens .
stuart brown : so i would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential -- where you set aside time to play -- but where your life becomes infused minute by minute , hour by hour , with body , object , social , fantasy , transformational kinds of play .
and i think you &apos;ll have a better and more empowered life .
thank you .
john hockenberry : so it sounds to me like what you &apos;re saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go -- i think i &apos;ve heard this , in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play , that somehow , the way animals and humans deal with play , is that it &apos;s some sort of rehearsal for adult activity .
your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong .
sb : yeah , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s accurate , and i think probably because animals have taught us that .
if you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do , and we &apos;ve all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they &apos;re just as good predators as they would be if they hadn &apos;t played .
and if you imagine a kid pretending to be king kong , or a race car driver , or a fireman , they don &apos;t all become race car drivers or firemen , you know .
so there &apos;s a disconnect between preparation for the future -- which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as -- and thinking of it as a separate biological entity .
and this is where my chasing animals for four , five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what i am now , which is that play has a biological place , just like sleep and dreams do .
and if you look at sleep and dreams biologically , animals sleep and dream , and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .
the next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .
and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
so it &apos;s not just something you do in your spare time .
how do you prevent either the media &apos;s interpretation of your work or the scientific community &apos;s interpretation of the implications of your work , kind of like the mozart metaphor , where , &quot; oh , mris show that play enhances your intelligence .
well , let &apos;s round these kids up , put them in pens and make them play for months at a time ; they &apos;ll all be geniuses and go to harvard . &quot;
how do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you &apos;re developing ?
sb : well , i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play .
so people know that it &apos;s there .
and then you get an fmri specialist , and you get frank wilson , and you get other kinds of hard scientists , including neuroendocrinologists .
and you get them into a group together focused on play , and it &apos;s pretty hard not to take it seriously .
unfortunately , that hasn &apos;t been done sufficiently for the national science foundation , national institute of mental health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously .
i mean you don &apos;t hear about anything that &apos;s like cancer or heart disease associated with play .
and yet i see it as something that &apos;s just as basic for survival -- long term -- as learning some of the basic things about public health .
jh : stuart brown , thank you very much .
stuart brown : play is more than just fun
a pioneer in research on play , dr. stuart brown says humor , games , roughhousing , flirtation and fantasy are more than just fun . plenty of play in childhood makes for happy , smart adults -- and keeping it up can make us smarter at any age .
ben roche : so i &apos;m ben , by the way .
homaro cantu : and i &apos;m homaro .
br : and we &apos;re chefs . so when moto opened in 2004 , people didn &apos;t really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the logo , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requests for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of printed food , and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation . so this is all the ingredients , all the flavor of , you know , a standard maki roll , printed onto a little piece of paper .
hc : so our diners started to get bored with this idea , and we decided to give them the same course twice , so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish .
so this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood .
the champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes . a little bit of seafood and some crème fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish .
br : but it &apos;s not all just edible pictures .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a carrot cake , put it in a blender , and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice , and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , jupiter &apos;s floating around your plate .
so yeah , we &apos;re transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for .
hc : delicious .
br : that &apos;s not it , though .
instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn &apos;t eat , we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know .
so this is a plate of nachos .
the difference between our nachos and the other guy &apos;s nachos , is that this is actually a dessert .
so the chips are candied , the ground beef is made from chocolate , and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese .
and after doing all of this dematerialization and reconfiguring of this , of these ingredients , we realized that it was pretty cool , because as we served it , we learned that the dish actually behaves like the real thing , where the cheese begins to melt .
so when you &apos;re looking at this thing in the dining room , you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos , and it &apos;s not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert , and it &apos;s just kind of like a mind-ripper .
hc : so we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic &apos;s shop than a kitchen , and the next logical step for us was to install a state-of-the-art laboratory , and that &apos;s what we have here .
so we put this in the basement , and we got really serious about food , like serious experimentation .
br : one of the really cool things about the lab , besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen , is that , you know , with this new equipment , and this new approach , all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open , and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created , they just kept going further and further out there .
hc : let &apos;s talk about flavor transformation , and let &apos;s actually make some cool stuff .
you see a cow with its tongue hanging out .
what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious . what is that cow eating ?
and why is it delicious ?
so the cow , basically , eats three basic things in their feed : corn , beets , and barley , and so what i do is i actually challenge my staff with these crazy , wild ideas . can we take what the cow eats , remove the cow , and then make some hamburgers out of that ?
and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this .
br : yeah , that &apos;s our chef de cuisine , chris jones . this is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task , but a lot of these ideas , they &apos;re hard to understand .
they &apos;re hard to just get automatically .
there &apos;s a lot of research and a lot of failure , trial and error -- i guess , more error -- that goes into each and every dish , so we don &apos;t always get it right , and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people .
hc : so , after about a day of chris and i staring at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty , and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat .
this is made from three ingredients : beets , barley , corn , and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat , looks and tastes like hamburger meat , and not only that , but it &apos;s basically removing the cow from the equation .
br : and it &apos;s definitely the world &apos;s first bleeding veggie burger , which is a cool side effect .
and a miracle berry , if you &apos;re not familiar with it , is a natural ingredient , and it contains a special property .
it &apos;s a glycoprotein called miraculin , a naturally occurring thing . it still freaks me out every time i eat it , but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue , so that primarily sour taste receptors , so normally things that would taste very sour or tart , somehow begin to taste very sweet .
hc : you &apos;re about to eat a lemon , and now it tastes like lemonade .
let &apos;s just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that .
we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas , and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit .
br : so you see us here cutting up some watermelon . the idea with this is that we &apos;re going to eliminate tons of food miles , wasted energy , and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna , or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place , with local , organic produce ; so we have a watermelon from wisconsin .
hc : so if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things , we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon , and it makes it go from sweet to savory .
so after we do that , we put it into a vacuum bag , add a little bit of seaweed , some spices , and we roll it , and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .
so the key now is to make it behave like tuna .
br : and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear , we really have something that looks , tastes and behaves like the real thing .
hc : so the key thing to remember here is , we don &apos;t really care what this tuna really is .
as long as it &apos;s good for you and good for the environment , it doesn &apos;t matter .
but where is this going ?
how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology ?
so here &apos;s the next challenge .
i told the staff , let &apos;s just take a bunch of wild plants , think of them as food ingredients . as long as they &apos;re non-poisonous to the human body , go out around chicago sidewalks , take it , blend it , cook it and then have everybody flavor-trip on it at moto .
let &apos;s charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think .
br : yeah , so you can imagine , a task like this -- this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for . but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general , because these are ingredients , you know , plant life that we &apos;re , one , unfamiliar with , and two , we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don &apos;t eat them .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture -- and that was the main issue with this challenge .
hc : so this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead .
so developing nations and first-world nations , imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them , food miles would basically turn into food feet .
and to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers , there &apos;s a bale of hay there and some crab apples .
and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients .
people swore they were eating barbecue sauce , and this is free food .
br : thanks , guys .
homaro cantu + ben roche : cooking as alchemy
homaro cantu and ben roche come from moto , a chicago restaurant that plays with new ways to cook and eat food . but beyond the fun and flavor-tripping , there &apos;s a serious intent : can we use new food technology for good ?
how does the news shape the way we see the world ?
here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass .
and here &apos;s how news shapes what americans see .
this map -- -- this map shows the number of seconds that american network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in february of 2007 -- just one year ago .
now , this was a month when north korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities .
there was massive flooding in indonesia .
and in paris , the ipcc released its study confirming man &apos;s impact on global warming .
the u.s. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
and when we take out the u.s. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of iraq -- that &apos;s that big green thing there -- and little else .
the combined coverage of russia , china and india , for example , reached just one percent .
when we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked .
what was that story ? the death of anna nicole smith .
this story eclipsed every country except iraq , and received 10 times the coverage of the ipcc report .
and the cycle continues ; as we all know , britney has loomed pretty large lately .
so , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
one reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half .
the reality is that covering britney is cheaper .
and this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news .
local tv news looms large , and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news .
and what about the web ?
the most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
and they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events .
similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from u.s. news creators is recycled stories from the ap wire services and reuters , and don &apos;t put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it .
so , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college graduates , as well as less educated americans , know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago .
and if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong .
in recent years , americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent .
the real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
and can we afford not to ? thank you .
alisa miller : the news about the news
alisa miller , head of public radio international , talks about why -- though we want to know more about the world than ever -- the us media is actually showing less . eye-opening stats and graphs .
hello ! my name is golan levin .
i &apos;m an artist and an engineer , which is , increasingly , a more common kind of hybrid .
but i still fall into this weird crack where people don &apos;t seem to understand me .
and i was looking around and i found this wonderful picture .
it &apos;s a letter from &quot; artforum &quot; in 1967 saying &quot; we can &apos;t imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art . &quot; and they still haven &apos;t .
and lest you think that you all , as the digerati , are more enlightened , i went to the apple iphone app store the other day .
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
and somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone , which my friends and i are doing now , is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .
in my own case , i &apos;m an artist , and i &apos;m really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action , and basically empowering people through interactivity .
i want people to discover themselves as actors , as creative actors , by having interactive experiences .
this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine .
and when i say desktop , i don &apos;t just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk .
if you look carefully , you can even see a hint of the apple menu , up here in the upper left , where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .
so this is , as joy mountford once said , &quot; the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through . &quot;
and the thing i &apos;m really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences .
how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences , not necessarily utilitarian ones .
so i write software . and that &apos;s how i do it .
and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way .
because this is , in some sense , the first way , that people discover their own potential as actors , and discover their own agency .
by saying &quot; who is that person in the mirror ? oh it &apos;s actually me . &quot;
and so , to give an example , this is a project from last year , which is called the interstitial fragment processor .
and it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they &apos;re just going about their everyday business .
so as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth , or with each other , these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air -- basically taking what &apos;s often this , kind of , unseen space , or this undetected space , and making it something real , that people then can appreciate and become creative with .
so again , people discover their creative agency in this way .
and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways .
so in addition to using full-body input , something that i &apos;ve explored now , for a while , has been the use of the voice , which is an immensely expressive system for us , vocalizing .
song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .
and i came across this fantastic research by wolfgang köhler , the so-called father of gestalt psychology , from 1927 , who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes .
and one of them is called taketa . which is which ?
maluma is on top . yeah . so .
so what we &apos;re really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia , which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have .
and so , whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
it &apos;s about mappings between different perceptual domains , like hardness , sharpness , brightness and darkness , and the phonemes that we &apos;re able to speak with .
so 70 years on , there &apos;s been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which , you know , l , m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this , and p , t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this .
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
so it occurred to me , what happens if we could run these backwards ?
and thus was born the project called remark , which is a collaboration with zachary lieberman and the ars electronica futurelab .
and this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .
and they sort of fly away , out of your head .
and if it isn &apos;t then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .
thanks . so . and this project here , i was working with the great abstract vocalist , jaap blonk .
and he is a world expert in performing &quot; the ursonate , &quot; which is a half-an-hour nonsense poem by kurt schwitters , written in the 1920s , which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense .
and it &apos;s almost impossible to perform .
but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
so these are our live subtitles , that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of &quot; the ursonate &quot; -- fortunately jaap does too , very well -- and it is delivering that text at the same time as jaap is .
so all the text you &apos;re going to see is real-time generated by the computer , visualizing what he &apos;s doing with his voice .
here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him .
okay . so ...
the full videos are online if you are interested .
i got a split reaction to that during the live performance , because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron , because usually there is someone making them afterwards .
i see subtitles all the time on television . &quot;
you know ? they don &apos;t imagine the person in the booth , typing it all .
so in addition to the full body , and in addition to the voice , another thing that i &apos;ve been really interested in , most recently , is the use of the eyes , or the gaze , in terms of how people relate to each other .
it &apos;s a really profound amount of nonverbal information that &apos;s communicated with the eyes .
and it &apos;s one of the most interesting technical challenges that &apos;s very currently active in the computer sciences : being able to have a camera that can understand , from a fairly big distance away , how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you &apos;re interested in , and where your attention is directed .
so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there .
and so i &apos;ve been beginning , with a variety of different projects , to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .
and basically to ask the questions : what if art was aware that we were looking at it ?
how could it respond , in a way , to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we &apos;re looking at it ?
and what could it do if it could look back at us ?
and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .
in the first one which i &apos;m going to show you , called eyecode , it &apos;s a piece of interactive software in which , if we read this little circle , &quot; the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer . &quot;
the idea is that it &apos;s an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation .
so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo .
there is just a little test screen that shows that it &apos;s working .
and you can see here that what it &apos;s doing is it &apos;s recording my eyes every time i blink .
hello ? and i can ... hello ... okay .
and no matter where i am , what &apos;s really going on here is that it &apos;s an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes .
and if i get really far away i &apos;m blurry .
you know , you &apos;re going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way .
but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you &apos;ll see these nice crisp eyes .
you can think of it as a way of , sort of , typing , with your eyes .
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at , as you see who &apos;s looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .
so i &apos;ll just add a couple more . blink . blink .
alright . let &apos;s leave that .
so that &apos;s this kind of recursive observation system .
thank you .
the last couple pieces i &apos;m going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics -- for me , new for me .
it &apos;s called opto-isolator .
and i &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
in this case , the opto-isolator is blinking in response to one &apos;s own blinks .
so it blinks one second after you do .
this is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials .
just one eye , looking at you , and eliminating everything else about a face , but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of , as an element .
and at the same time , it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors .
like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy , or things like that .
okay . so the last project i &apos;m going to show is this new one called snout .
it &apos;s an eight-foot snout , with a googly eye .
and inside it &apos;s got an 800-pound robot arm that i borrowed , from a friend .
it helps to have good friends .
i &apos;m at carnegie mellon ; we &apos;ve got a great robotics institute there .
i &apos;d like to show you thing called snout , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it &apos;s continually surprised to see you .
the idea is that basically -- if it &apos;s constantly like &quot; huh ? ... huh ? &quot;
and the idea is basically , can it look at you and make you feel as if like , &quot; what ? is it my shoes ? &quot;
&quot; got something on my hair ? &quot; here we go . alright .
checking him out ...
for you nerds , here &apos;s a little behind-the-scenes .
it &apos;s got a computer vision system , and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most .
those are its targets .
up there is the skeleton , which is actually what it &apos;s trying to do .
it &apos;s really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature .
hollywood does this all the time , of course .
but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it .
this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you , and it &apos;s interested in looking at you .
and i &apos;m really happy to be here . thank you so much .
golan levin : art that looks back at you
golan levin , an artist and engineer , uses modern tools -- robotics , new software , cognitive research -- to make artworks that surprise and delight . watch as sounds become shapes , bodies create paintings , and a curious eye looks back at the curious viewer .
when most people think about the beginnings of aids , they &apos;re gonna think back to the 1980s .
and certainly , this was the decade in which we discovered aids and the virus that causes it , hiv .
but in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before , from chimpanzees , where the virus originated , into humans who hunt these apes .
this photo was taken before the great depression in brazzaville , congo .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with hiv .
so i have a couple of really important questions for you .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus ?
ok now , more importantly , had we been there in the &apos; 40s and &apos; 50s , &apos; 60s , had we seen this disease , had we understood exactly what was going on with it , how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?
and you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations .
but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human .
nevertheless , we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid , trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings , that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we &apos;ve seen in the case of hiv .
so during the last 15 years , i &apos;ve been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i &apos;ve labeled &quot; viral chatter , &quot; which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .
this is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations , the movement of these agents over into humans ; and by capturing this moment , we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early .
ok , so this is a picture , and i &apos;m going to show you some pictures now from the field .
this is a picture of a central african hunter .
it &apos;s actually a fairly common picture .
one of the things i want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact .
this was absolutely key for us . this is a very intimate form of connection .
so if we &apos;re going to study viral chatter , we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals .
and so we &apos;ve been studying people like this individual .
we collect blood from them , other specimens .
we look at the diseases , which are in the animals as well as the humans .
and ideally , this is going to allow us to catch these things early on , as they &apos;re moving over into human populations .
and the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals , but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis .
when they were sick , we would collect specimens from them .
we would actually enlist them -- which we &apos;ve done now -- to collect specimens from animals .
we give them these little pieces of filter paper .
when they sample from animals , they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hunted .
deep in a remote region of cameroon , two hunters stalk their prey .
their names are patrice and patee .
patrice and patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes .
they have a series of traps , of snares that they &apos;ve set up to catch wild pigs , snakes , monkeys , rodents -- anything they can , really .
patrice and patee have been out for hours but found nothing .
the animals are simply gone .
we stop for a drink of water .
then there is a rustle in the brush .
a group of hunters approach , their packs loaded with wild game .
there &apos;s at least three viruses that you know about , which are in this particular monkey .
nathan wolfe : this species , yeah . and there &apos;s many many more pathogens that are present in these animals .
these individuals are at specific risk , particularly if there &apos;s blood contact , they &apos;re at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses .
as the hunters display their kills , something surprising happens .
they show us filter paper they &apos;ve used to collect the animals &apos; blood .
the blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses , part of a program dr. wolfe has spent years setting up .
nw : so this is from this animal right here , greater spot-nosed guenon .
every person who has one of those filter papers has at least , at a minimum , been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities , which presumably , from our perspective , gives them the ability to decrease their own risk , and then obviously the risk to their families , the village , the country , and the world .
nw : ok , before i continue , i think it &apos;s important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat . bush meat is the hunting of wild game .
ok ? and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat .
i &apos;m going to be talking about this .
when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they &apos;re gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren &apos;t able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
but in fact that &apos;s not the only question they &apos;re going to ask you about this .
they &apos;re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
they &apos;re going to say , in regions of profound instability throughout the world , where you have intense poverty , where populations are growing and you don &apos;t have sustainable resources like this , this is going to lead to food insecurity .
it &apos;s one that i think we all need to ask ourselves , which is , why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here .
now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder -- this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that i showed you .
ok , take a look at his shirt .
you know , take a look at his face .
bush meat is one of the central crises , which is occurring in our population right now , in humanity , on this planet .
but it can &apos;t be the fault of somebody like this .
ok ? and solving it cannot be his responsibility alone .
there &apos;s no easy solutions , but what i &apos;m saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril .
so , in 1998 , along with my mentors don burke and colonel mpoudi-ngole , we went to actually start this work in central africa , to work with hunters in this part of the world .
and my job -- at that time i was a post-doctoral fellow , and i was really tasked with setting this up .
so i said to myself , &quot; ok , great -- we &apos;re gonna collect all kinds of specimens . we &apos;re gonna go to all these different locations . it &apos;s going to be wonderful . &quot;
you know , i looked at the map ; i picked out 17 sites ; i figured , no problem .
needless to say , i was drastically wrong .
this is challenging work to do .
fortunately , i had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that &apos;s the only way that this work can really occur .
we have a whole range of challenges about this work .
one of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field .
the person you see on the right hand side is paul delong-minutu .
he &apos;s one of the best communicators that i &apos;ve really ever dealt with .
when i arrived i didn &apos;t speak a word of french , and i still seemed to understand what it was he was saying .
paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health correspondent .
so we figured we &apos;d hire this person -- when we got there he could be a great communicator .
but -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
often we run into obstacles . this is us coming back from one of these very rural sites , with specimens from 200 individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours .
i like to show this shot -- this is ubald tamoufe , who &apos;s the lead investigator in our cameroon site .
ubald laughs at me when i show this photo because of course you can &apos;t see his face .
but the reason i like to show the shot is because you can see that he &apos;s about to solve this problem .
which -- which he did , which he did .
just a few quick before and after shots .
this was our laboratory before .
this is what it looks like now .
early on , in order to ship our specimens , we had to have dry ice . to get dry ice we had to go to the breweries -- beg , borrow , steal to get these folks to give it to us .
now we have our own liquid nitrogen .
i like to call our laboratory the coldest place in central africa -- it might be .
and here &apos;s a shot of me , this is the before shot of me .
no comment .
so what happened ? so during the 10 years that we &apos;ve been doing this work , we actually surprised ourselves .
we made a number of discoveries .
and what we &apos;ve found is that if you look in the right place , you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations .
that gave us a tremendous amount of hope .
what we &apos;ve found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses in the same group as hiv -- so , brand new retroviruses .
and let &apos;s face it , any new retrovirus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
it &apos;s something we should be following . it &apos;s not something that we should be surprised by .
that &apos;s no longer the case . logging roads provide access to urban areas .
and critically , what happens in central africa doesn &apos;t stay in central africa .
so , once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring , we decided to move this from research , to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort .
through generous support and partnership scientifically with google.org and the skoll foundation , we were able to start the global viral forecasting initiative and begin work in four different sites in africa and asia .
needless to say , different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact .
so it &apos;s not just hunters in central africa .
it &apos;s also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where sars emerged in asia .
but really , this is just the beginning from our perspective .
our objective right now , in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving , is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots -- because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things , ideally , before they make it to blood banks , sexual networks , airplanes . and that &apos;s really our objective .
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us .
it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves .
many people , i think , on our planet right now despair , and they think we &apos;ve reached a point where we &apos;ve discovered most of the things .
i &apos;m going tell you right now : please don &apos;t despair .
if an intelligent extra-terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet , 27 out of 30 of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus , with just a few of the volumes left for plants , fungus and animals , humans being a footnote ; interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless .
this is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet .
the dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about .
and yet finally , we have the tools , which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them .
nathan wolfe : the jungle search for viruses
virus hunter nathan wolfe is outwitting the next pandemic by staying two steps ahead : discovering deadly new viruses where they first emerge -- passing from animals to humans among poor subsistence hunters in africa -- before they claim millions of lives .
four years ago , on the ted stage , i announced a company i was working with at the time called odeo .
and because of that announcement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deciding to become ceo of that company -- whereas i was just an adviser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring .
one of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey , and a year later , when we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo , jack presented an idea he &apos;d been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends .
now , it &apos;s hard to justify doing a side project at a startup , where focus is so critical , but i had actually launched blogger as a side project to my previous company , thinking it was just a little thing we &apos;d do on the side , and it ended up taking over not only the company , but my life for the next five or six years .
so i learned to follow hunches even though you can &apos;t necessarily justify them or know where they &apos;re going to go .
and that &apos;s kind of what &apos;s happened with twitter , time after time .
so , for those of you unfamiliar , twitter is based around a very simple , seemingly trivial concept .
you say what you &apos;re doing in 140 characters or less , and people who are interested in you get those updates .
if they &apos;re really interested , they get the update as a text message on their cell phone .
so , for instance , i may twitter right now that i &apos;m giving a talk at ted .
and in my case , when i hit send , up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds .
now , the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want , be they momentous occasions or mundane ones .
it is by sharing these moments as they &apos;re happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch , despite distance , and in real time .
this is the primary use we saw of twitter from the beginning , and what got us excited .
what we didn &apos;t anticipate was the many , many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system .
one of the things we realized was how important twitter could be during real-time events .
when the wildfires broke out in san diego , in october of 2007 , people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them .
but it wasn &apos;t just individuals .
the l.a. times actually turned to twitter to dispense information as well , and put a twitter feed on the front page , and the l.a. fire department and red cross used it to dispense news and updates as well .
at this event , dozens of people here are twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what &apos;s happening .
among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses , from marketing and communications and predictable things , to an insanely popular korean-barbecue taco truck that drives around l.a. and twitters where it stops , causing a line to form around the block .
politicians have recently begun twittering .
in fact , there are 47 members of congress who currently have twitter accounts .
and they &apos;re tweeting , in some cases , from behind closed-door sessions with the president .
in this case , this guy &apos;s not liking what he &apos;s hearing .
as have this guy &apos;s .
twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium : you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you &apos;re interested in .
one of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message .
so , this syntax , the &quot; @ username &quot; that shaquille o &apos;neal &apos;s using here to reply to one of his fans , was completely invented by users , and we didn &apos;t build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier .
this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system .
another is via the api .
we built an application-programming interface , which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
we currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send twitter updates -- interfaces for mac , windows , your iphone , your blackberry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks or a plant twitter when it needs water .
probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in virginia called summize .
summize built a twitter search engine .
and they tapped into the fact that , if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they &apos;re doing and what &apos;s around them , you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it &apos;s going on .
this really changed how we perceived twitter .
for instance , here &apos;s what people are saying about ted .
this is another way that our mind was shifted , and twitter wasn &apos;t what we thought it was .
we liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product .
this not only lets you view twitters in different ways , but it introduces new use cases as well .
one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta .
some users figured out that they would twitter when they found gas -- where it was , and how much it cost -- and then appended the keyword &quot; # atlgas &quot; which let other people search for that and find gas themselves .
and this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends .
it &apos;s happened more and more lately , whether it &apos;s raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa or for a family in crisis .
people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occasions .
it seems like when you give people easier ways to share information , more good things happen .
i &apos;ve learned to follow the hunch , but never assume where it will go .
we &apos;re not quite done yet .
so , look , if we could have this screen live .
this is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they &apos;ve been to an event .
it &apos;s totally intimidating .
so , this would be the twitter search screen .
for example : &quot; evan williams . &quot;
&quot; evan williams , give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at ted . &quot;
&quot; evan williams is just dying on stage here at ted .
worst talk ever ! &quot;
evan williams : nice . thanks .
but , literally in the eight minutes he was talking , there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk .
so he &apos;ll see every aspect of the reaction : the fact that barack obama is the biggest twitterer , the fact that it came out of ted .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any other way of getting instant feedback that way .
you have build something very fascinating , and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it .
that was very interesting .
in the year leading up to this talk , the web tool twitter exploded in size . co-founder evan williams reveals that many of the ideas driving that growth came from unexpected uses invented by the users themselves .
i &apos;m a storyteller .
and i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call &quot; the danger of the single story . &quot;
i grew up on a university campus in eastern nigeria .
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth .
so i was an early reader , and what i read were british and american children &apos;s books .
now , this despite the fact that i lived in nigeria .
i had never been outside nigeria .
we didn &apos;t have snow , we ate mangoes , and we never talked about the weather , because there was no need to .
my characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the british books i read drank ginger beer .
never mind that i had no idea what ginger beer was .
and for many years afterwards , i would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer .
but that is another story .
what this demonstrates , i think , is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story , particularly as children .
because all i had read were books in which characters were foreign , i had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which i could not personally identify .
things changed when i discovered african books .
there weren &apos;t many of them available , and they weren &apos;t quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
but because of writers like chinua achebe and camara laye i went through a mental shift in my perception of literature .
i realized that people like me , girls with skin the color of chocolate , whose kinky hair could not form ponytails , could also exist in literature .
i started to write about things i recognized .
now , i loved those american and british books i read .
they stirred my imagination . they opened up new worlds for me .
but the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature .
so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this : it saved me from having a single story of what books are .
i come from a conventional , middle-class nigerian family .
my father was a professor .
my mother was an administrator .
and so we had , as was the norm , live-in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
his name was fide .
the only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
and when i didn &apos;t finish my dinner my mother would say , &quot; finish your food ! don &apos;t you know ? people like fide &apos;s family have nothing . &quot;
so i felt enormous pity for fide &apos;s family .
then one saturday we went to his village to visit , and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made .
i was startled .
it had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something .
all i had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
their poverty was my single story of them .
years later , i thought about this when i left nigeria to go to university in the united states .
i was 19 .
my american roommate was shocked by me .
she asked where i had learned to speak english so well , and was confused when i said that nigeria happened to have english as its official language .
she asked if she could listen to what she called my &quot; tribal music , &quot; and was consequently very disappointed when i produced my tape of mariah carey .
she assumed that i did not know how to use a stove .
what struck me was this : she had felt sorry for me even before she saw me .
her default position toward me , as an african , was a kind of patronizing , well-meaning pity .
my roommate had a single story of africa : a single story of catastrophe .
in this single story there was no possibility of africans being similar to her in any way , no possibility of feelings more complex than pity , no possibility of a connection as human equals .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &apos;t consciously identify as african .
but in the u.s. whenever africa came up people turned to me .
but i did come to embrace this new identity , and in many ways i think of myself now as african .
although i still get quite irritable when africa is referred to as a country , the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago , in which there was an announcement on the virgin flight about the charity work in &quot; india , africa and other countries . &quot;
so after i had spent some years in the u.s. as an african , i began to understand my roommate &apos;s response to me .
if i had not grown up in nigeria , and if all i knew about africa were from popular images , i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes , beautiful animals , and incomprehensible people , fighting senseless wars , dying of poverty and aids , unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind , white foreigner .
i would see africans in the same way that i , as a child , had seen fide &apos;s family .
this single story of africa ultimately comes , i think , from western literature .
now , here is a quote from the writing of a london merchant called john locke , who sailed to west africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage .
after referring to the black africans as &quot; beasts who have no houses , &quot; he writes , &quot; they are also people without heads , having their mouth and eyes in their breasts . &quot;
now , i &apos;ve laughed every time i &apos;ve read this .
and one must admire the imagination of john locke .
but what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling african stories in the west : a tradition of sub-saharan africa as a place of negatives , of difference , of darkness , of people who , in the words of the wonderful poet rudyard kipling , are &quot; half devil , half child . &quot;
and so i began to realize that my american roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story , as had a professor , who once told me that my novel was not &quot; authentically african . &quot;
now , i was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel , that it had failed in a number of places , but i had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called african authenticity .
in fact i did not know what african authenticity was .
the professor told me that my characters were too much like him , an educated and middle-class man .
my characters drove cars .
they were not starving .
therefore they were not authentically african .
but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
a few years ago , i visited mexico from the u.s.
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was tense , and there were debates going on about immigration .
and , as often happens in america , immigration became synonymous with mexicans .
i remember walking around on my first day in guadalajara , watching the people going to work , rolling up tortillas in the marketplace , smoking , laughing .
and then i was overwhelmed with shame .
i realized that i had been so immersed in the media coverage of mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind , the abject immigrant .
i had bought into the single story of mexicans and i could not have been more ashamed of myself .
so that is how to create a single story , show a people as one thing , as only one thing , over and over again , and that is what they become .
it is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power .
there is a word , an igbo word , that i think about whenever i think about the power structures of the world , and it is &quot; nkali . &quot;
it &apos;s a noun that loosely translates to &quot; to be greater than another . &quot;
like our economic and political worlds , stories too are defined by the principle of nkali : how they are told , who tells them , when they &apos;re told , how many stories are told , are really dependent on power .
power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person , but to make it the definitive story of that person .
the palestinian poet mourid barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people , the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with , &quot; secondly . &quot;
start the story with the arrows of the native americans , and not with the arrival of the british , and you have an entirely different story .
start the story with the failure of the african state , and not with the colonial creation of the african state , and you have an entirely different story .
i recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel .
i told him that i had just read a novel called american psycho -- -- and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers .
now , obviously i said this in a fit of mild irritation .
but it would never have occurred to me to think that just because i had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all americans .
this is not because i am a better person than that student , but because of america &apos;s cultural and economic power , i had many stories of america .
i had read tyler and updike and steinbeck and gaitskill .
i did not have a single story of america .
when i learned , some years ago , that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful , i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me .
but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
my cousin polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .
one of my closest friends , okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
i grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education , so that sometimes my parents were not paid their salaries .
and so , as a child , i saw jam disappear from the breakfast table , then margarine disappeared , then bread became too expensive , then milk became rationed .
and most of all , a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives .
all of these stories make me who i am .
but to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me .
the single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
they make one story become the only story .
of course , africa is a continent full of catastrophes : there are immense ones , such as the horrific rapes in congo and depressing ones , such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in nigeria .
but there are other stories that are not about catastrophe , and it is very important , it is just as important , to talk about them .
i &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
the consequence of the single story is this : it robs people of dignity .
it makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult .
it emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar .
so what if before my mexican trip i had followed the immigration debate from both sides , the u.s. and the mexican ?
what if my mother had told us that fide &apos;s family was poor and hardworking ?
what if we had an african television network that broadcast diverse african stories all over the world ?
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls &quot; a balance of stories . &quot;
what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher , mukta bakaray , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?
now , the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don &apos;t read literature .
he disagreed . he felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
now you must write a sequel , and this is what will happen ... &quot;
and she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel .
i was not only charmed , i was very moved .
here was a woman , part of the ordinary masses of nigerians , who were not supposed to be readers .
she had not only read the book , but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel .
now , what if my roommate knew about my friend fumi onda , a fearless woman who hosts a tv show in lagos , and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget ?
what if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the lagos hospital last week ?
what if my roommate knew about contemporary nigerian music , talented people singing in english and pidgin , and igbo and yoruba and ijo , mixing influences from jay-z to fela to bob marley to their grandfathers .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband &apos;s consent before renewing their passports ?
what if my roommate knew about nollywood , full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds , films so popular that they really are the best example of nigerians consuming what they produce ?
what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider , who has just started her own business selling hair extensions ?
or about the millions of other nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
every time i am home i am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most nigerians : our failed infrastructure , our failed government , but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government , rather than because of it .
i teach writing workshops in lagos every summer , and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are eager to write , to tell stories .
my nigerian publisher and i have just started a non-profit called farafina trust , and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don &apos;t have anything in their libraries , and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops , for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories .
stories matter .
many stories matter .
stories have been used to dispossess and to malign , but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize .
stories can break the dignity of a people , but stories can also repair that broken dignity .
the american writer alice walker wrote this about her southern relatives who had moved to the north .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of paradise was regained . &quot;
i would like to end with this thought : that when we reject the single story , when we realize that there is never a single story about any place , we regain a kind of paradise .
chimamanda ngozi adichie : the danger of a single story
our lives , our cultures , are composed of many overlapping stories . novelist chimamanda adichie tells the story of how she found her authentic cultural voice -- and warns that if we hear only a single story about another person or country , we risk a critical misunderstanding .
it &apos;s monday morning .
in washington , the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office , assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda in yemen .
at number 10 downing street , david cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession .
in madrid , maria gonzalez is standing at the door , listening to her baby crying and crying , trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it .
and i am sitting by my father &apos;s bedside in hospital , trying to work out whether i should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said , &quot; you must make him drink today , &quot; -- my father &apos;s been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether , by giving him this bottle , i might actually kill him .
we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives , and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .
we talk things over with our friends , we scour the internet , we search through books .
but still , even in this age of google and tripadvisor and amazon recommends , it &apos;s still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters .
because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity , we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own .
and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing , we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do .
but i believe that this is a big problem , a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society , as a culture and as individuals .
it &apos;s not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have .
the problem lies with us : we &apos;ve become addicted to experts .
we &apos;ve become addicted to their certainty , their assuredness , their definitiveness , and in the process , we have ceded our responsibility , substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom .
this is no exaggeration .
in a recent experiment , a group of adults had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to experts speak .
the results were quite extraordinary .
as they listened to the experts &apos; voices , the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off .
it literally flat-lined .
and they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice , however right or wrong .
did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10 ?
did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself , you &apos;re statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you ?
and then there &apos;s , of course , the example that we &apos;re all too aware of : financial experts getting it so wrong that we &apos;re living through the worst recession since the 1930s .
for the sake of our health , our wealth and our collective security , it &apos;s imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on .
and i &apos;m saying this as an economist who , over the past few years , has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why , but also -- and i &apos;m aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself , as a professor , as somebody who advises prime ministers , heads of big companies , international organizations , but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change , that we need to become more open-minded , more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view .
so in order to help you understand where i &apos;m coming from , let me bring you into my world , the world of experts .
now there are , of course , exceptions , wonderful , civilization-enhancing exceptions .
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus .
alan greenspan &apos;s proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on , not challenged by his peers , until after the crisis , of course .
you see , we also learn that experts are located , are governed , by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in victorian england , say , who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire , or the psychiatrists in the united states who , up until 1973 , were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness .
and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we &apos;ve all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects , or studies funded by food companies of their new products , massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they &apos;re about to bring by market .
the study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study .
and we &apos;ve also got to be aware that experts , of course , also make mistakes .
they make mistakes every single day -- mistakes born out of carelessness .
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries , operating on the wrong side of the brain , carrying out procedures on the wrong hand , elbow , eye , foot , and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .
a common thinking error of radiologists , for example -- when they look at ct scans -- is that they &apos;re overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient &apos;s problem to be .
so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia , say , what happens is that , if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan , they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient &apos;s lungs .
i &apos;ve shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts .
these are , of course , not the only insights i could share , but i hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them , why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on .
but how can we do this ?
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies .
first , we &apos;ve got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles .
in every single subject , you &apos;ll be relieved to hear .
but it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when , for example , we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand .
why was it that , when i had an operation , &quot; beware , ms. hertz , of hyperpyrexia , &quot; when he could have just as easily said , &quot; watch out for a high fever . &quot;
you see , being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs , their equations , their forecasts , their prophecies , and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like : what are the assumptions that underpin this ?
what is the evidence upon which this is based ?
what has your investigation focused on ?
and what has it ignored ?
it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , primarily on male animals and then , primarily on men .
it seems that they &apos;ve somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world &apos;s population are women .
and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don &apos;t work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they &apos;re actively harmful for women to take .
being a rebel is about recognizing that experts &apos; assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed .
second , we need to create the space for what i call &quot; managed dissent . &quot;
if we are to shift paradigms , if we are to make breakthroughs , if we are to destroy myths , we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out , in which we &apos;re bringing in new , diverse , discordant , heretical views into the discussion , fearlessly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that , by surrounding ourselves by divergent , discordant , heretical views .
all the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter .
encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts , which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true .
and that &apos;s why i talk about the need to actively manage dissent .
google ceo eric schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .
in meetings , he looks out for the person in the room -- arms crossed , looking a bit bemused -- and draws them into the discussion , trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion , so that they have dissent within the room .
managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement , discord and difference .
but we need to go even further .
we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .
the conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees , fancy titles , diplomas , best-selling books -- high-status individuals .
best buy , the consumer electronics company , gets all its employees -- the cleaners , the shop assistants , the people in the back office , not just its forecasting team -- to place bets , yes bets , on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before christmas , on whether customers &apos; new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company , on whether a project will come in on time .
by leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company , best buy was able to discover , for example , that the store that it was going to open in china -- its big , grand store -- was not going to open on time .
because when it asked its staff , all its staff , to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not , a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening .
it turned out that they were aware , as no one else within the company was , of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts , nor the experts on the ground in china , were even aware of .
the strategies that i have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent , taking experts on , democratizing expertise , rebellious strategies -- are strategies that i think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing , complex , difficult times .
for if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on , if we challenge experts , if we &apos;re skeptical , if we devolve authority , if we are rebellious , but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance , uncertainty and doubt , and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too , we will set ourselves up much better for now , more than ever , is not the time to be blindly following , blindly accepting , blindly trusting .
now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes , using experts to help us figure things out , for sure -- i don &apos;t want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and , of course , also our own .
thank you .
noreena hertz : how to use experts -- and when not to
we make important decisions every day -- and we often rely on experts to help us decide . but , says economist noreena hertz , relying too much on experts can be limiting and even dangerous . she calls for us to start democratizing expertise -- to listen not only to &quot; surgeons and ceos , but also to shop staff . &quot;
i &apos;d like to talk about my dad .
my dad has alzheimer &apos;s disease .
he started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago , and he was officially diagnosed in 2005 .
now he &apos;s really pretty sick . he needs help eating , he needs help getting dressed , he doesn &apos;t really know where he is or when it is , and it &apos;s been really , really hard .
my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life , and i &apos;ve spent the last decade watching him disappear .
my dad &apos;s not alone . there &apos;s about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia , and by 2030 they &apos;re expecting that to double to 70 million .
that &apos;s a lot of people .
dementia scares us . the confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia , the big numbers of people who get it , they frighten us .
and because of that fear , we tend to do one of two things : we go into denial : &quot; it &apos;s not me , it has nothing to do with me , it &apos;s never going to happen to me . &quot;
or , we decide that we &apos;re going to prevent dementia , and it will never happen to us because we &apos;re going to do everything right and it won &apos;t come and get us .
i &apos;m looking for a third way : i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
prevention is good , and i &apos;m doing the things that you can do to prevent alzheimer &apos;s .
but the research also shows that there &apos;s nothing that will 100 percent protect you .
if the monster wants you , the monster &apos;s gonna get you .
that &apos;s what happened with my dad .
my dad was a bilingual college professor . his hobbies were chess , bridge and writing op-eds .
he got dementia anyway .
if the monster wants you , the monster &apos;s gonna get you .
especially if you &apos;re me , &apos; cause alzheimer &apos;s tends to run in families .
so i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
based on what i &apos;ve learned from taking care of my father , and researching what it &apos;s like to live with dementia , i &apos;m focusing on three things in my preparation : i &apos;m changing what i do for fun , i &apos;m working to build my physical strength , and -- this is the hard one -- i &apos;m trying to become a better person .
let &apos;s start with the hobbies . when you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
you can &apos;t sit and have long talks with your old friends , because you don &apos;t know who they are .
it &apos;s confusing to watch television , and often very frightening .
and reading is just about impossible .
when you care for someone with dementia , and you get training , they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar , hands-on , open-ended .
with my dad , that turned out to be letting him fill out forms .
he was a college professor at a state school ; he knows what paperwork looks like .
he &apos;ll sign his name on every line , he &apos;ll check all the boxes , he &apos;ll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers .
but it got me thinking , what would my caregivers do with me ?
i &apos;m my father &apos;s daughter . i read , i write , i think about global health a lot .
would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins ?
would they give me charts and graphs that i could color ?
so i &apos;ve been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on .
i am learning some basic origami . i can make a really great box .
and i &apos;m teaching myself to knit , which so far i can knit a blob .
but , you know , it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m actually good at it . what matters is that my hands know how to do it .
because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain &apos;s not running the show anymore .
they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier , easier for their caregivers to look after , and it may even slow the progress of the disease .
that all seems like win to me .
a lot of people don &apos;t know that alzheimer &apos;s actually has physical symptoms , as well as cognitive symptoms . you lose your sense of balance , you get muscle tremors , and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile .
they get scared to walk around . they get scared to move .
i &apos;m doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance , so that when i start to lose it , i &apos;ll still be able to be mobile .
i &apos;m doing weight-bearing exercise , so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither , i have more time that i can still move around .
finally , the third thing . i &apos;m trying to become a better person .
i &apos;ve seen him lose his intellect , his sense of humor , his language skills , but i &apos;ve also seen this : he loves me , he loves my sons , he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
when you take away everything that he ever learned in this world , his naked heart still shines .
i was never as kind as my dad , and i was never as loving .
and what i need now is to learn to be like that .
i need a heart so pure that if it &apos;s stripped bare by dementia , it will survive .
i don &apos;t want to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
what i want is a cure in the next 20 years , soon enough to protect me .
thank you .
alanna shaikh : how i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s
when faced with a parent suffering from alzheimer &apos;s , most of us respond with denial or extreme efforts at prevention . but global health expert and fellow alanna shaikh sees it differently . she &apos;s taking three concrete steps to prepare for the moment -- should it arrive -- when she herself gets alzheimer &apos;s disease .
it never left my brain .
and i started playing with it more like a puzzle .
the original thought i had : this must be ethanol .
so i went out and researched ethanol , and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country .
about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen , until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth , which is , you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car , if you use hydrogen .
and then sort of through a process of wandering around , i got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
now i started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse .
not how do you build one car , but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99 percent of the population ?
the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today .
so one , it has to be more convenient than a car .
affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan , right ?
alright ? that &apos;s not something that we can finance or buy today .
and convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight .
so we &apos;re bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
and so the thought that i started with was how do you do this , still within the boundary of the science we know today -- no time for science fair , no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up .
how do you do it within the economics that we have today ?
how do you do it from the power of the consumer up ?
on a random visit to tesla on some afternoon , i actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .
in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic &quot; batteries not included . &quot;
now if you separate between the two , you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network , by creating a network before the cars show up .
the network has two components in them .
first component is you charge the car whenever you stop -- ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours .
and so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
now it sounds crazy . but in some places around the world , like scandinavia , you already have that .
if you park your car and didn &apos;t plug in the heater , when you come back you don &apos;t have a car . it just doesn &apos;t work .
now that last mile , last foot , in a sense , is the first step of the infrastructure .
the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension .
see we &apos;re bound by today &apos;s technology on batteries , which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations .
but you never want to get stuck .
so what we added is a second element to our network , which is a battery swap system .
you drive . you take your depleted battery out .
a full battery comes on . and you drive on .
it looks like a car wash . you come into your car wash .
and a plate comes up , holds your battery , takes it out , puts it back in , and within two minutes you &apos;re back on the road and you can go again .
if you had charge spots everywhere , and you had battery swap stations everywhere , how often would you do it ? and it ends up that you &apos;d do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it &apos;s an inconvenience .
then we looked at the question of the affordability .
we looked at the question , what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car .
what is the cost of that battery ?
everybody tells us batteries are so expensive .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electrons , something interesting happens .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
remember in your car you have a gas tank .
and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline .
the battery in this sense , is the crude oil .
we have a battery bay . it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .
but the crude oil is replaced with a battery .
just it doesn &apos;t burn . it consumes itself step after step after step .
it has 2,000 life cycles these days .
and so it &apos;s sort of a mini well .
we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well , for the life of the car .
nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car .
in a sense what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve created a new consumable .
and we created electric miles .
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .
today 2010 , in volume , when we come to market , it is eight cents a mile .
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we &apos;re in in the u.s.
20 miles per gallon that &apos;s a buck 50 , a buck 60 a gallon .
that &apos;s cheaper than today &apos;s gasoline , even in the u.s.
in europe where taxes are in place , that &apos;s the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
but e-miles follow moore &apos;s law .
they go from eight cents a mile in 2010 , to four cents a mile in 2015 , to two cents a mile by 2020 .
why ? because batteries life cycle improve -- a bit of improvement on energy density , which reduces the price .
and these prices are actually with clean electrons .
so in a sense this is an absolute zero-carbon , zero-fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 .
that is an 80 cent gallon .
an 80 cent gallon means , if the entire pacific would convert to crude oil , and we &apos;d let any oil company bring it out and refine it , they still can &apos;t compete with two cents a mile .
that &apos;s a new economic factor , which is fascinating to most people .
now this would have been a wonderful paper .
that &apos;s how i solved it in my head . it was a white paper i handed out to governments .
and some governments told me that it &apos;s fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things .
until i got to the true young global leader , shimon peres , president of israel , and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me .
first he let me go to the prime minister of the country , who told me , if you can find the money you need for this network , 200 million dollars , and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume , in two million cars -- that &apos;s what we needed in israel -- i &apos;ll give you country to invest the 200 million into .
peres thought that was a great idea .
so we went out , and we looked at all the car companies .
we sent letters to all the car companies .
three of them never showed up . one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount .
but one of them carlos ghosn , ceo of renault and nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating .
he said hybrids are like mermaids .
when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish .
and ghosn came up and said , &quot; i have the car , mr. peres ; i will build you the cars . &quot;
and actually true to form , renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume -- mass volume being the first year , 100 thousand cars .
it &apos;s the first mass-volume electric car , zero-emission electric car in the market .
i was running , as chris said , to be the ceo of a large software company called sap and then peres said , &quot; well won &apos;t you run this project ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m ready for ceo &quot; and he said , &quot; oh no no no no no . you &apos;ve got to explain to me , what is more important than saving your country and saving the world , that you would go and do ? &quot;
and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place .
we then decided to scale it up .
and denmark set this beautiful policy ; it &apos;s called the iq test .
it &apos;s inversely proportional to taxes .
they put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero-emission cars .
so if you want to buy a gasoline car in denmark , it costs you about 60,000 euros .
if you buy our car it &apos;s about 20,000 euros .
if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country .
we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands .
i know most people don &apos;t think of israel as a small island , but israel is an island -- it &apos;s a transportation island .
if your car is driving outside israel it &apos;s been stolen .
if you &apos;re thinking about it in terms of islands , we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find , and that was australia . the third country we announced was australia .
it &apos;s got three centers -- in brisbane , in melbourne , in sydney -- and one freeway , one electric freeway that connects them .
the next island was not too hard to find , and that was hawaii .
we decided to come into the u.s.
and pick the two best places -- the one where you didn &apos;t need any range extension .
hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery .
and if you really have a long day you can switch , and keep on driving around the island .
the second one was the san francisco bay area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors .
he decided that he &apos;s going to take over the state , unofficially , and then officially , and then created this beautiful region one policy .
in the san francisco bay area not only do you have the highest concentration of priuses , but you also have the perfect range extender .
it &apos;s called the other car .
as we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ?
why is this a big issue ?
you don &apos;t notice it , but when the aggregate comes up you &apos;re dead . alright ?
so the price of oil , much like lots of other curves that we &apos;ve seen , goes along a depletion curve .
the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .
and we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground .
it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
you think , well it &apos;s been up , it &apos;s been down , its been up , it &apos;s going to keep on going up and down .
here is the problem : at 147 dollars a barrel , which we were in six months ago , the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil .
then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 -- sometimes it &apos;s 40 , sometimes it &apos;s 50 .
now we &apos;re running a stimulus package .
it &apos;s called the trillion-dollar stimulus package .
we &apos;re going to revive the economy . hopefully it happens between now and 2015 , somewhere in that space .
what happens when the economy recovers ?
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we &apos;re going at right now .
that &apos;s another 30 percent demand on oil .
that is another 25 million barrels a day .
that &apos;s all the u.s. usage today .
in other words at some point when we &apos;ve recovered we go up to the peak .
and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel .
we take our money and we give it away .
you know what happens at that point ?
we go back down . it &apos;s going to go up and down .
and the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter .
now we actually looked at what the answer would be .
right ? remember in the campaign : one million hybrid cars by 2015 .
that is 0.5 percent of the u.s. oil consumption .
that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world .
that won &apos;t do much difference .
we looked at an mit study : ten million electric cars on the global roads .
ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then .
it &apos;s also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from 100 thousand cars is 2011 , to 10 million cars by 2016 -- 100 x growth in less than five years .
you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .
we have 10 million cars by region .
that &apos;s an enormous amount of cars .
china is adding those cars -- india , russia , brazil .
we have all these regions .
europe has solved it . they just put a tax on gasoline .
they &apos;ll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high .
china solves it by an edict . at some point they &apos;ll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city , and that will be it .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on range , not a reduction in range .
we don &apos;t have the industry set right .
we don &apos;t have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s.
now where is the car industry on that ?
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
no infrastructure , no problem .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
all this stuff that happens around .
we are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 -- a whole new market , a whole new business model .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car -- the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you &apos;ll pay for the miles .
and some of it will go back to the car maker .
some of it will go back to your own pocket .
but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars .
you &apos;re looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills .
in denmark , we will drive all the cars in denmark from windmills , not from oil .
in israel , we &apos;ve asked to put a solar farm in the south of israel .
and people said , &quot; oh that &apos;s a very very large space that you &apos;re asking for . &quot;
and we said , &quot; what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? &quot;
and they said , &quot; we tried . there isn &apos;t any . &quot;
we said , &quot; no no , but what if we prove it ? &quot;
and they said , &quot; well you can dig . &quot; and we decided to dig up , instead of digging down .
these are perfect matches to one another .
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years .
that &apos;s one percent a year .
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
and those are not 20 percent by 2020 .
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can &apos;t stop thinking of padding co2 .
we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .
and actually 700 and change million cars today emit 2.8 billion tons of co2 .
that &apos;s , in the additive , about 25 percent of our problem .
cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world &apos;s co2 emissions .
we have to come and attack this problem with a focus , with an effort that actually says , we &apos;re going to go to zero before the world ends .
i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u.s.
i shared it with a gentleman called bobby kennedy jr . , who is one of my idols .
i told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said we &apos;re going to send a man to the moon , and we &apos;ll do it by the end of the decade .
we didn &apos;t say we &apos;re going to send a man 20 percent to the moon .
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we &apos;ll recover him .
he actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
200 years ago , in parliament , in great britain , there was a long argument over economy versus morality .
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars -- 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the u.k.
and there was an argument . should we stop using slaves ?
and what would it do to our economy ?
and people said , &quot; well we need to take time to do it .
let &apos;s not do it immediately . maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves .
and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery , and the industrial revolution started within less than one year .
and the u.k. had 100 years of economic growth .
we have to make the right moral decision .
we have to make it immediately .
and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years , but within this presidential term because if we don &apos;t , we will lose our economy , right after we &apos;d lost our morality .
shai agassi : a new ecosystem for electric cars
that splendid music , the coming-in music -- &quot; the elephant march &quot; from &quot; aida &quot; -- is the music i &apos;ve chosen for my funeral -- -- and you can see why . it &apos;s triumphal .
i won &apos;t feel anything , but if i could , i would feel triumphal at having lived at all , and at having lived on this splendid planet , and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why i was here in the first place , before not being here .
can you understand my quaint english accent ?
like everybody else , i was entranced yesterday by the animal session .
robert full and frans lanting and others -- the beauty of the things they showed .
the only slight jarring note was when jeffrey katzenberg said of the mustang , &quot; the most splendid creatures that god put on this earth . &quot;
now of course , we know that he didn &apos;t really mean that , but in this country at the moment , you can &apos;t be too careful .
i &apos;m a biologist , and the central theorem of our subject : the theory of design , darwin &apos;s theory of evolution by natural selection .
in professional circles everywhere , it &apos;s of course universally accepted .
in non-professional circles outside america , it &apos;s largely ignored .
but in non-professional circles within america , it arouses so much hostility -- -- that it &apos;s fair to say that american biologists are in a state of war .
the war is so worrying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
if you want to know what i have to say about darwinism itself , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to have to look at my books , which you won &apos;t find in the bookstore outside .
contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism , called &quot; intelligent design , &quot; or id .
don &apos;t be fooled . there &apos;s nothing new about id .
it &apos;s just creationism under another name , rechristened -- i choose the word advisedly -- -- for tactical , political reasons .
the arguments of so-called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again , since darwin down to the present day .
there is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science , and i try to do all i can to help them , but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists .
they see us as rocking the boat , and you can understand why .
creationists , lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case , fall back on the popular phobia against atheism .
in fact , of course , educated theologians from the pope down are firm in their support of evolution .
this book , &quot; finding darwin &apos;s god , &quot; by kenneth miller , is one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know , and it &apos;s all the more effective because it &apos;s written by a devout christian .
people like kenneth miller could be called a &quot; godsend &quot; to the evolution lobby -- -- because they expose the lie that evolutionism is , as a matter of fact , tantamount to atheism .
but here , i want to say something nice about creationists .
it &apos;s not a thing i often do , so listen carefully .
i think they &apos;re right about one thing .
i think they &apos;re right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion .
i &apos;ve already said that many individual evolutionists , like the pope , are also religious , but i think they &apos;re deluding themselves .
i believe a true understanding of darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith .
now , it may sound as though i &apos;m about to preach atheism , and i want to reassure you that that &apos;s not what i &apos;m going to do .
in an audience as sophisticated as this one , that would be preaching to the choir .
no , what i want to urge upon you -- -- instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism .
but that &apos;s putting it too negatively .
if i was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith , i would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science , and indeed science generally , but evolution in particular , to inspire and enthrall , precisely because it is atheistic .
now , the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things .
statistical improbability in the direction of good design -- &quot; complexity &quot; is another word for this .
the standard creationist argument -- there is only one ; they all reduce to this one -- takes off from a statistical improbability .
living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance ; therefore , they must have had a designer .
this argument of course , shoots itself in the foot .
any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself , and that &apos;s before we even start on the other things he &apos;s expected to do , like forgive sins , bless marriages , listen to prayers -- favor our side in a war -- -- disapprove of our sex lives and so on .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex , thereby simply compounding the problem .
darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity .
but here , i only want to make the point that the elegance of darwinism is corrosive to religion precisely because it is so elegant , so parsimonious , so powerful , so economically powerful .
it has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge .
the god theory is not just a bad theory .
it turns out to be , in principle , incapable of doing the job required of it .
so , returning to tactics and the evolution lobby , i want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do .
my approach to attacking creationism is unlike the evolution lobby .
my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole , and at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion , and i &apos;m going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams , a dear friend who , if he never came to ted , certainly should have been invited .
richard dawkins : he was . good . i thought he must have been .
he begins this speech which was tape-recorded in cambridge shortly before he died .
he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof , and then he goes on .
i quote , &quot; religion doesn &apos;t seem to work like that .
it has certain ideas at the heart of it , which we call &apos; sacred &apos; or &apos; holy . &apos; what it means is : here is an idea or a notion that you &apos;re not allowed to say anything bad about .
you &apos;re just not . why not ? because you &apos;re not .
why should it be that it &apos;s perfectly legitimate to support the republicans or democrats , this model of economics versus that , macintosh instead of windows , but to have an opinion about how the universe began , about who created the universe -- no , that &apos;s holy .
so , we &apos;re used to not challenging religious ideas and it &apos;s very interesting how much of a furor richard creates when he does it . &quot; he meant me , not that one .
&quot; everybody gets absolutely frantic about it , because you &apos;re not allowed to say these things , yet when you look at it rationally , there is no reason why those ideas shouldn &apos;t be as open to debate as any other , except that we &apos;ve agreed somehow between us that they shouldn &apos;t be . &quot; and that &apos;s the end of the quote from douglas .
in my view , not only is science corrosive to religion ; religion is corrosive to science .
it teaches people to be satisfied with trivial , supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp .
it teaches them to accept authority , revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence .
there &apos;s douglas adams , magnificent picture from his book , &quot; last chance to see . &quot;
now , there &apos;s a typical scientific journal , the quarterly review of biology .
and i &apos;m going to put together , as guest editor , a special issue on the question , &quot; did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs ? &quot;
perfectly ordinary scientific paper .
now , the next one , &quot; the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction &quot; -- -- &quot; ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
&quot; it has been privately revealed to professor huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
&quot; professor hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith &quot; -- -- &quot; ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
&quot; professor hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal hawkinsians that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
that &apos;s inconceivable , of course .
but suppose -- -- in 1987 , a reporter asked george bush , sr.
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists .
&quot; no , i don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
this is one nation under god . &quot;
bush &apos;s bigotry was not an isolated mistake , blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted .
he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal .
he really meant it .
more to the point , he knew it posed no threat to his election , quite the contrary .
democrats as well as republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected . both parties invoke &quot; one nation under god . &quot;
what would thomas jefferson have said ?
incidentally , i &apos;m not usually very proud of being british , but you can &apos;t help making the comparison .
in practice , what is an atheist ?
an atheist is just somebody who feels about yahweh the way any decent christian feels about thor or baal or the golden calf .
as has been said before , we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in . some of us just go one god further .
and however we define atheism , it &apos;s surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic , unelectable non-citizen .
nevertheless , it &apos;s an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as mr. hitler or miss beelzebub .
natalie angier wrote a rather sad piece in the new yorker , saying how lonely she felt as an atheist .
she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority , but actually , how do american atheists stack up numerically ?
the latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading .
christianity , of course , takes a massive lion &apos;s share of the population , with nearly 160 million .
but what would you think was the second largest group , convincingly outnumbering jews with 2.8 million , muslims at 1.1 million , and hindus , buddhists and all other religions put together ?
the second largest group , of nearly 30 million , is the one described as non-religious or secular .
you can &apos;t help wondering why vote-seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of , for example , the jewish lobby .
the state of israel seems to owe its very existence to the american jewish vote , while at the same time consigning the non-religious to political oblivion .
this secular non-religious vote , if properly mobilized , is nine times as numerous as the jewish vote .
why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
well , so much for quantity . how about quality ?
is there any correlation , positive or negative , between intelligence and tendency to be religious ?
the survey that i quoted , which is the aris survey , didn &apos;t break down its data by socio-economic class or education , iq or anything else .
but a recent article by paul g. bell in the mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind .
mensa , as you know , is an international organization for people with very high iq .
and from a meta-analysis of the literature , bell concludes that , i quote , &quot; of 43 studies carried out since 1927 on the relationship between religious belief and one &apos;s intelligence or educational level , all but four found an inverse connection .
that is , the higher one &apos;s intelligence or educational level , the less one is likely to be religious . &quot;
well , i haven &apos;t seen the original 42 studies and i can &apos;t comment on that meta-anaysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines .
and i know that there are , if i could put a little plug here , there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question , and i put the suggestion up -- for what it &apos;s worth .
but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group , namely , top scientists .
in 1998 , larson and witham polled the cream of american scientists , those who &apos;d been honored by election to the national academy of sciences , and among this select group , belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent .
about 20 percent are agnostic , and the rest could fairly be called atheists .
among biological scientists , the figures are even lower : 5.5 percent , only , believe in god . physical scientists : it &apos;s 7.5 percent .
i &apos;ve not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such history or philosophy , but i &apos;d be surprised if they were different .
so , we &apos;ve reached a truly remarkable situation , a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia and the american electorate .
a philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe , which is held by the vast majority of top american scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally , is so abhorrent to the american electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public .
if i &apos;m right , this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it -- the intelligentsia -- unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs .
to put it bluntly , american political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest .
i &apos;m not a citizen of this country , so i hope it won &apos;t be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done .
and i &apos;ve already hinted what that something is .
from what i &apos;ve seen of ted , i think this may be the ideal place to launch it .
again , i fear it will cost money .
we need a consciousness-raising , coming-out campaign for american atheists .
this could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago , although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will .
in most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists .
on the contrary , they &apos;ll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children , the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product , the kinds of people who are sitting in this room .
there should be a snowball effect , a positive feedback , such that the more names we have , the more we get .
there could be non-linearities , threshold effects .
when a critical mass has been attained , there &apos;s an abrupt acceleration in recruitment .
and again , it will need money .
i suspect that the word &quot; atheist &quot; itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means , and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .
so , what other words might be used to smooth the path , oil the wheels , sugar the pill ? darwin himself preferred &quot; agnostic &quot; -- and not only out of loyalty to his friend huxley , who coined the term .
darwin said , &quot; i have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a god .
he even became uncharacteristically tetchy with edward aveling .
what happened was that aveling &apos;s mistress was marx &apos;s daughter , and when both darwin and marx were dead , marx &apos;s papers became muddled up with aveling &apos;s papers and a letter from darwin saying , &quot; my dear sir , thank you very much but i don &apos;t want you to dedicate your book to me , &quot; was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to marx , and that gave rise to this whole myth , which you &apos;ve probably heard .
it &apos;s a sort of urban myth , that marx tried to dedicate &quot; kapital &quot; to darwin .
anyway , it was aveling , and when they met , darwin challenged aveling , &quot; why do you call yourselves atheists ? &quot;
&quot; &apos; agnostic , &apos; &quot; retorted aveling , &quot; was simply &apos; atheist &apos; writ respectable , and &apos; atheist &apos; was simply &apos; agnostic &apos; writ aggressive . &quot;
darwin complained , &quot; but why should you be so aggressive ? &quot;
darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia , but that ordinary people were not , quote , &quot; ripe for it . &quot;
which is , of course , our old friend , the &quot; don &apos;t rock the boat &quot; argument .
it &apos;s not recorded whether aveling told darwin to come down off his high horse .
but in any case , that was more than 100 years ago .
you think we might have grown up since then .
now , a friend , an intelligent lapsed jew , who incidentally observed the sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity , describes himself as a &quot; tooth fairy agnostic . &quot;
he won &apos;t call himself an atheist because it &apos;s , in principle , impossible to prove a negative , but agnostic on its own might suggest that god &apos;s existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence .
so , my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy , but it isn &apos;t very likely , is it ? like god .
hence the phrase , &quot; tooth fairy agnostic . &quot;
you would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about mars , but that doesn &apos;t mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence .
the list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn &apos;t stop at tooth fairies and teapots . it &apos;s infinite .
if you want to believe one particular one of them -- unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or yahweh -- the onus is on you to say why .
the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .
we , who are atheists , are also a-fairiests and a-teapotists .
but we don &apos;t bother to say so , and this is why my friend uses &quot; tooth fairy agnostic &quot; as a label for what most people would call atheist .
nonetheless , if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly , we &apos;re going to have find something better to stick on our banner than &quot; tooth fairy &quot; or &quot; teapot agnostic . &quot;
so , how about &quot; humanist &quot; ?
my problem with it only is its apparent anthropocentrism .
one of the things we &apos;ve learned from darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins , some close , some distant .
and there are other possibilities like &quot; naturalist , &quot; but that also has problems of confusion , because darwin would have thought naturalist -- &quot; naturalist &quot; means , of course , as opposed to &quot; supernaturalist &quot; -- and it is used sometimes -- darwin would have been confused by the other sense of &quot; naturalist , &quot; which he was , of course , and i suppose there might be others who would confuse it with nudism .
such people might be those belonging to the british lynch mob which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile .
it lacks the strong connotation that there &apos;s definitely no god , and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics .
it &apos;s completely compatible with the god of the physicists .
when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word &quot; god , &quot; they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep , mysterious part of physics which we don &apos;t yet understand .
&quot; non-theist &quot; will do for all that , yet unlike &quot; atheist , &quot; it doesn &apos;t have the same phobic , hysterical responses .
but i think , actually , the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word &quot; atheism &quot; itself , precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia .
critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word &quot; atheist &quot; than with the word &quot; non-theist , &quot; or some other non-confrontational word .
but if we did achieve it with that dread word -- &quot; atheist &quot; itself -- the political impact would be even greater .
now , i said that if i were religious , i &apos;d be very afraid of evolution . i &apos;d go further .
and this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting , more poetic , more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination .
as carl sagan , another recently dead hero , put it , &quot; how is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded , &apos; this is better than we thought !
the universe is much bigger than our prophet said , grander , more subtle , more elegant ? &apos; instead they say , &apos; no , no , no !
my god is a little god , and i want him to stay that way . &apos; a religion , old or new , that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths . &quot;
now , this is an elite audience , and i would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious .
many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion , but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do .
if you &apos;re one of them , and of course many of you may not be , but if you are one of them , i &apos;m asking you to stop being polite , come out and say so , and if you happen to be rich , give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference .
the religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits -- by foundations such as the templeton foundation and the discovery institute .
we need an anti-templeton to step forward .
if my books sold as well as stephen hawking &apos;s books , instead of only as well as richard dawkins &apos; books , i &apos;d do it myself .
well , here &apos;s how it changed me .
let &apos;s all stop being so damned respectful .
thank you very much .
richard dawkins : militant atheism
richard dawkins urges all atheists to openly state their position -- and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science . a fiery , funny , powerful talk .
one of the problems of writing , and working , and looking at the internet is that it &apos;s very hard to separate fashion from deep change .
and so , to start helping that , i want to take us back to 1835 .
in 1835 , james gordon bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper in new york city .
and it cost about 500 dollars to start it , which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today .
10,000 , two and a half million , 15 years .
that &apos;s the critical change that is being inverted by the net .
and that &apos;s what i want to talk about today , and how that relates to the emergence of social production .
starting with newspapers , what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information , knowledge and culture , which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital , just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce .
now , the term &quot; information society , &quot; &quot; information economy , &quot; for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution . but in fact , for purposes of understanding what &apos;s happening today , that &apos;s wrong . because for 150 years , we &apos;ve had an information economy .
it &apos;s just been industrial , which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars , and later , more for the telegraph , and the radio transmitter , and the television , and eventually the mainframe .
and that meant they were market based , or they were government owned , depending on what kind of system they were in . and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years .
now , let me tell you a different story . around june 2002 , the world of supercomputers had a bombshell .
the japanese had , for the first time , created the fastest supercomputer -- the nec earth simulator -- taking the primary from the u.s. , and about two years later -- this , by the way , is measuring the trillion floating-point operations per second that the computer &apos;s capable of running -- sigh of relief : ibm &#91; blue gene &#93; has just edged ahead of the nec earth simulator .
all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period , there &apos;s another supercomputer running in the world -- seti @ home .
four and a half million users around the world , contributing their leftover computer cycles , whenever their computer isn &apos;t working , by running a screen saver , and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized . not that it &apos;s become less capital intensive -- that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s required -- but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitalization happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
they &apos;re not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network .
what this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution , the most important means , the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember , we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies , and there more than anywhere else , are in the hands of the population at large . this is completely different than what we &apos;ve seen since the industrial revolution . so we &apos;ve got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population , and we &apos;ve got human creativity , human wisdom , human experience -- the other major experience , the other major input -- which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long -- is not something that &apos;s the same or fungible among people .
any one of you who has taken someone else &apos;s job , or tried to give yours to someone else , no matter how detailed the manual , you cannot transmit what you know , what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances .
in that we &apos;re unique , and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine .
what &apos;s the effect of this ? so , the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software .
this is market share of apache web server -- one of the critical applications in web-based communications .
in 1995 , two groups of people said , &quot; wow , this is really important , the web ! we need a much better web server ! &quot;
one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided , you know , we really need this , we should write one , and what are we going to do with what -- well , we &apos;re gonna share it ! and other people will be able to develop it .
the other was microsoft .
now , if i told you that 10 years later , the motley crew of people , who didn &apos;t control anything that they produced , acquired 20 percent of the market and was the red line , it would be amazing ! right ?
think of it in minivans . a group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with toyota . right ?
but , in fact , of course , the story is it &apos;s the 70 percent , including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical application on which web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form , in direct competition with microsoft . not in a side issue -- in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the net .
software has done this in a way that &apos;s been very visible , because it &apos;s measurable . but the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the web .
so , nasa , at some point , did an experiment where they took images of mars that they were mapping , and they said , instead of having three or four fully trained ph.d.s doing this all the time , let &apos;s break it up into small components , put it up on the web , and see if people , using a very simple interface , will actually spend five minutes here , 10 minutes there , clicking . after six months , 85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in , which was , quote , &quot; practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained ph.d. , &quot; once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average .
now , if you have a little girl , and she goes and writes to -- well , not so little , medium little -- tries to do research on barbie .
and she &apos;ll come to encarta , one of the main online encyclopedias .
this is what you &apos;ll find out about barbie . this is it , there &apos;s nothing more to the definition , including , &quot; manufacturers &quot; -- plural -- &quot; now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls , like this black barbie . &quot; which is vastly better than what you &apos;ll find in the encyclopedia.com , which is barbie , klaus .
on the other hand , if they go to wikipedia , they &apos;ll find a genuine article -- and i won &apos;t talk a lot about wikipedia , because jimmy wales is here -- but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the britannica , differently written , including the controversies over body image and commercialization , the claims about the way in which she &apos;s a good role model , etc .
another portion is not only how content is produced , but how relevance is produced .
the claim to fame of yahoo ! was , we hire people to look -- originally , not anymore -- we hire people to look at websites and tell you -- if they &apos;re in the index , they &apos;re good . this , on the other hand , is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project , each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about , to say , this is good . so , this is the open directory project , with 60,000 volunteers , each one spending a little bit of time , as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees . no one owns it , no one owns the output , it &apos;s free for anyone to use and it &apos;s the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting .
this is not only outside of businesses . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what &apos;s relevant -- to the community of the web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page rank .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- vanity , pleasure -- produced links , and tied to each other . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up .
and again , here , you see barbie.com , but also , very quickly , adiosbarbie.com , the body image for every size . a contested cultural object , which you won &apos;t find anywhere soon on overture , which is the classic market-based mechanism : whoever pays the most is highest on the list .
but remember , the computers were also physical . just physical materials -- our pcs -- we share them together . we also see this in wireless .
it used to be wireless was one person owned the license , they transmitted in an area , and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .
what we &apos;re seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we &apos;re developing algorithms to let people own machines , like wi-fi devices , and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle : when i &apos;m listening , when i &apos;m not using , i can help you transfer your messages ; and when you &apos;re not using , you &apos;ll help me transfer yours .
and this is not an idealized version . these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented , at least for public security .
if in 1999 i told you , let &apos;s build a data storage and retrieval system .
it has to support over 100 million users at any given moment . it &apos;s got to be robust to attack , including closing the main index , injecting malicious files , armed seizure of some major nodes . you &apos;d say that would take years .
it would take millions . but of course , what i &apos;m describing is p2p file sharing .
right ? we always think of it as stealing music , but fundamentally , it &apos;s a distributed data storage and retrieval system , where people , for very obvious reasons , are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something .
so , essentially what we &apos;re seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework . it used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things . they could be market based , or non-market based ; they could be decentralized , or centralized .
the price system was a market-based and decentralized system .
if things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them , you had firms , if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governments or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market .
it was too expensive to have decentralized social production , to have decentralized action in society . that was not about society itself .
that was , in fact , economic .
but what we &apos;re seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
not that it &apos;s the first time that we do nice things to each other , or for each other , as social beings . we do it all the time .
what characterizes them is decentralized authority .
you don &apos;t have to ask permission , as you do in a property-based system .
may i do this ? it &apos;s open for anyone to create and innovate and share , if they want to , by themselves or with others , because property is one mechanism of coordination .
instead , what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market : information flows to decide what are interesting problems ; who &apos;s available and good for something ; motivation structures -- remember , money isn &apos;t always the best motivator .
if you leave a $ 50 check after dinner with friends , you don &apos;t increase the probability of being invited back .
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex .
it also requires certain new organizational approaches .
you have to hire them to spend a lot of time .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
five minutes , instead of watching tv ?
five minutes i &apos;ll spend just because it &apos;s interesting . just because it &apos;s fun .
just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning , or , in places that are more involved , like wikipedia , gives me a certain set of social relations .
so , a new social phenomenon is emerging .
it &apos;s creating , and it &apos;s most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .
peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry ; free and open source software taking market share from microsoft ; skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms ; wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias .
but it &apos;s also a new source of opportunities for businesses .
as you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging , you have new opportunities . some of them are toolmakers .
instead of building well-behaved appliances -- things that you know what they &apos;ll do in advance -- you begin to build more open tools . there &apos;s a new set of values , a new set of things people value .
you build platforms for self-expression and collaboration .
like wikipedia , like the open directory project , you &apos;re beginning to build platforms , and you see that as a model .
you have a belief : stuff will flow out of connected human beings .
that &apos;ll give me something i can use , and i &apos;m going to contract with someone .
i will deliver something based on what happens . it &apos;s very scary -- that &apos;s what google does , essentially .
that &apos;s what ibm does in software services , and they &apos;ve done reasonably well .
so , social production is a real fact , not a fad .
it is the critical long-term shift caused by the internet .
social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon . in some contexts , it &apos;s even more efficient because of the quality of the information , the ability to find the best person , the lower transaction costs . it &apos;s sustainable and growing fast .
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .
so next time you open the paper , and you see an intellectual property decision , a telecoms decision , it &apos;s not about something small and technical .
because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes , or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model , and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see .
thank you .
yochai benkler : the new open-source economics
yochai benkler explains how collaborative projects like wikipedia and linux represent the next stage of human organization .
thank you very much , chris . everybody who came up here said they were scared . i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m scared , but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this .
and i don &apos;t have any smart technology for you to look at .
there are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me .
what i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa .
already this morning there were some allusions to the africa that you hear about all the time : the africa of hiv / aids , the africa of malaria , the africa of poverty , the africa of conflict , and the africa of disasters .
while it is true that those things are going on , there &apos;s an africa that you don &apos;t hear about very much .
and sometimes i &apos;m puzzled , and i ask myself why .
this is the africa that is changing , that chris alluded to .
this is the africa of opportunity .
this is the africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies .
and this is the africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this . that &apos;s what i want to talk about today .
and i want to start by telling you a story about that change in africa .
on 15th of september 2005 , mr. diepreye alamieyeseigha , a governor of one of the oil-rich states of nigeria , was arrested by the london metropolitan police on a visit to london .
he was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family .
this arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the london metropolitan police and the economic and financial crimes commission of nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people : mr. nuhu ribadu .
alamieyeseigha was arraigned in london .
due to some slip-ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our constitution , those in office as governors , president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted . but what happened : people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office .
today , alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail .
this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good , and not taken out to places where they &apos;ll benefit just a few of the elite .
and therefore , when you hear about the corrupt africa -- corruption all the time -- i want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries , and that some successes are emerging .
does it mean the problem is over ? the answer is no .
there &apos;s still a long way to go , but that there &apos;s a will there .
and that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight .
so when you hear about corruption , don &apos;t just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can &apos;t operate in any african country because of the overwhelming corruption . that is not the case .
there &apos;s a will to fight , and in many countries , that fight is ongoing and is being won . in others , like mine , where there has been a long history of dictatorship in nigeria , the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go .
but the truth of the matter is that this is going on .
the results are showing : independent monitoring by the world bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption , and governance is improving .
a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 african countries .
and let me say just one more thing before i leave this area of governance .
that is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa .
that &apos;s the image : african countries . but let me say this : if alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in london -- if the other people who had taken money , estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries &apos; monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they &apos;re able to do this , what is that ? is that not corruption ?
in this country , if you receive stolen goods , are you not prosecuted ?
so when we talk about this kind of corruption , let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money &apos;s going and what can be done to stop it .
i &apos;m working on an initiative now , along with the world bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries &apos; moneys -- to get that sent back .
because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back , it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .
the second thing i want to talk about is the will for reform .
africans , after -- they &apos;re tired , we &apos;re tired of being the subject of everybody &apos;s charity and care .
we are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform .
and what is happening in many african countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us . we have to do it .
we have to reform our economies , change our leadership , become more democratic , be more open to change and to information .
and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent , nigeria .
in fact , if you &apos;re not in nigeria , you &apos;re not in africa .
i want to tell you that .
one in four sub-saharan africans is nigerian , and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people . you &apos;ll never be bored .
what we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
and with the support of a leader who was willing , at the time , to do the reforms , we put forward a comprehensive reform program , which we developed ourselves .
not the international monetary fund . not the world bank , where i worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president .
no one can do it for you . you have to do it for yourself .
we put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in .
the state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it &apos;s inefficient and incompetent .
so we decided to privatize many of our enterprises .
we -- as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets .
can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when i left washington to go and take up the post of finance minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history ?
having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
you couldn &apos;t get it . you had to bribe .
you had to do everything to get your phone .
when president obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector , we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million gsm lines , and counting .
nigeria &apos;s telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world , after china . we are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms . and nobody knows , except a few smart people .
the smartest one , first to come in , was the mtn company of south africa .
and in the three years that i was finance minister , they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year .
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country , with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita .
when they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know .
nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies , and three or four others have come in .
but there &apos;s a huge market out there , and people don &apos;t know about it , or they don &apos;t want to know .
so privatization is one of the things we &apos;ve done .
the other thing we &apos;ve also done is to manage our finances better .
because nobody &apos;s going to help you and support you if you &apos;re not managing your own finances well .
and nigeria , with the oil sector , had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well .
so what did we try to do ? we introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price .
before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in , because oil is the biggest , most revenue-earning sector in the economy : 70 percent of our revenues come from oil .
we de-linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price .
we didn &apos;t know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial .
but what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where , even if oil prices were high , we would grow very fast .
and we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy .
that smoothened out . we were able to save , just before i left , 27 billion dollars . whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when i arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves .
by the time i left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . and as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .
and that shores up our economy , makes it stable .
our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy .
we brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
and we had gdp grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now .
so all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-oil .
agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
we have opportunities in solid minerals . we have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored . and we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible , that wouldn &apos;t happen . so we &apos;ve now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world .
we have opportunities in housing and real estate .
there was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping malls as you know them here .
this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people .
and now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected .
so , huge things in construction , real estate , mortgage markets . financial services : we had 89 banks . too many not doing their real business .
we consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital .
and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
the banks -- these banks are now consolidated , and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside .
barclays bank of the u.k. is bringing in 500 million .
standard chartered has brought in 140 million .
and i can go on . dollars , on and on , into the system .
we are doing the same with the insurance sector .
so in financial services , a great deal of opportunity .
in tourism , in many african countries , a great opportunity .
and that &apos;s what many people know east africa for : the wildlife , the elephants , and so on .
but managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important .
so what am i trying to say ? i &apos;m trying to tell you that there &apos;s a new wave on the continent .
a new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two-thirds of african countries have had multi-party democratic elections .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
i &apos;m trying to tell you that since the past three years , the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum .
so it &apos;s clear that things are changing .
conflicts are down on the continent ; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago , we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible , of course , of which is darfur .
and , you know , you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent , it looks like the entire continent is affected .
but you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries , not one country .
and if we are down to three or four conflicts , it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable , growing , exciting economies where there &apos;s plenty of opportunity .
and i want to just make one point about this investment .
the best way to help africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet .
and the best way to do that is by helping create jobs .
there &apos;s no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children &apos;s lives . that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying . that is fine .
but imagine the impact on a family : if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .
if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet , isn &apos;t that a wonderful opportunity ? isn &apos;t that the way to go ?
and i want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women .
i have a cd here . i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t say anything on time .
otherwise , i would have liked you to have seen this .
it says , &quot; africa : open for business . &quot;
and this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year .
understand that the woman who made it is going to be in tanzania , where they &apos;re having the session in june .
but it shows you africans , and particularly african women , who against all odds have developed businesses , some of them world-class .
one of the women in this video , adenike ogunlesi , making children &apos;s clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business .
mixing african materials , such as we have , with materials from elsewhere .
so , she &apos;ll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys , with african material mixed in . very creative designs , has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal-mart .
for 10,000 pieces .
and the women are diligent . they are focused ; they work hard .
i could go on giving examples : beatrice gakuba of rwanda , who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the dutch auction in amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her .
however , many of these are starved for capital to expand , because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary . nobody thinks in terms of a market .
nobody thinks there &apos;s opportunity .
but i &apos;m standing here saying that those who miss the boat now , will miss it forever .
so if you want to be in africa , think about investing .
think about the beatrices , think about the adenikes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed , and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income .
so i invite you to explore the opportunities .
when you go to tanzania , listen carefully , because i &apos;m sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent , for the people and for yourselves .
ngozi okonjo-iweala : want to help africa ? do business here
we know the negative images of africa -- famine and disease , conflict and corruption . but , says ngozi okonjo-iweala , there &apos;s another , less-told story happening in many african nations : one of reform , economic growth and business opportunity .
do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
heart disease , cancer , a car accident ?
most of us worry about things we can &apos;t control , like war , terrorism , the tragic earthquake that just occurred in haiti .
but what really threatens humanity ?
a few years ago , professor vaclav smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history .
he called these , &quot; massively fatal discontinuities , &quot; meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
he looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic eruption , even of an asteroid hitting the earth .
but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent , and that is a severe flu pandemic .
now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold , but it can be a death sentence .
every year , 36,000 people in the united states die of seasonal flu .
in the developing world , the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher .
in 1918 , a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people .
it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms .
are we safer today ?
well , we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared , but this threat could reappear at any time .
the good news is that we &apos;re at a moment in time when science , technology , globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility : the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth .
we can do this .
we &apos;re already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
but with new or better vaccines for malaria , tb , hiv , pneumonia , diarrhea , flu , we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time .
so , i &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
but first , i have to explain why they &apos;re important because vaccines , the power of them , is really like a whisper .
when they work , they can make history , but after a while you can barely hear them .
now , some of us are old enough to have a small , circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children .
but when was the last time you worried about smallpox , a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us ?
or polio ? how many of you remember the iron lung ?
we don &apos;t see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .
now , it &apos;s interesting because there are 30-odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we &apos;re still threatened by things like hiv and flu .
well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
until recently , we haven &apos;t had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
we knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
you took a pathogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
this worked well for most pathogens , somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural immunity .
so let &apos;s explore how vaccines work .
now , when you get a viral infection , what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength , and that might be too late .
when you &apos;re pre-immunized , what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .
so that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
now , let &apos;s take a look at a video that we &apos;re debuting at ted , for the first time , on how an effective hiv vaccine might work .
a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader .
after hiv penetrates the body &apos;s mucosal barriers , it infects immune cells to replicate .
the invader draws the attention of the immune system &apos;s front-line troops .
dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
memory cells generated by the hiv vaccine are activated when they learn hiv is present from the front-line troops .
these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed .
memory b cells turn into plasma cells , which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto hiv to prevent it from infecting cells , while squadrons of killer t cells seek out and destroy cells that are already hiv infected .
the virus is defeated .
without a vaccine , these responses would have taken more than a week .
by that time , the battle against hiv would already have been lost .
seth berkley : really cool video , isn &apos;t it ?
the antibodies you just saw in this video , in action , are the ones that make most vaccines work .
so the real question then is : how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and hiv ?
the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
so let &apos;s take a look at the flu virus .
in this rendering of the flu virus , these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you .
and also , what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus .
when these mutate , they change their shape , and the antibodies don &apos;t know what they &apos;re looking at anymore .
it &apos;s also why in the spring , we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year , put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall .
even worse , the most common influenza -- influenza a -- also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans , and they can recombine in those particular animals .
in addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
so , you &apos;ve got this situation : in 2003 , we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent .
now luckily , that particular virus , although very scary at the time , did not transmit from person to person very easily .
this year &apos;s h1n1 threat was actually a human , avian , swine mixture that arose in mexico .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
and so , in a sense , our luck is holding out , but you know , another wild bird could fly over at anytime .
now let &apos;s take a look at hiv .
as variable as flu is , hiv makes flu look like the rock of gibraltar .
the virus that causes aids is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted .
it mutates furiously , it has decoys to evade the immune system , it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome .
here &apos;s a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to hiv , a much wilder target .
in the video a moment ago , you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells .
now realize that in a recently infected person , there are millions of these ships ; each one is just slightly different .
finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder .
now , in the 27 years since hiv was identified as the cause of aids , we &apos;ve developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together .
these drugs aren &apos;t cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence at least for those who can access them .
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .
large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business .
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
in september , we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in thailand .
newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models .
but in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual .
now , what does this mean ?
we saw earlier that hiv is highly variable , that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus .
if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models , they provide full protection from infection .
in addition , these researchers found a new site on hiv where the antibodies can grab onto , and what &apos;s so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates .
it &apos;s like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it &apos;s still wearing the same socks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks .
so what we &apos;ve got is a situation .
the thai results tell us we can make an aids vaccine , and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that .
this strategy , working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate , has never been done before in vaccine research .
it &apos;s called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv .
so think of it this way .
we &apos;ve got these new antibodies we &apos;ve identified , and we know that they latch onto many , many variations of the virus .
we know that they have to latch onto a specific part , so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part , present that through a vaccine , what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies .
and that would create a universal hiv vaccine .
now , it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site , and as you can imagine , these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on .
and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this , we &apos;d love to hear about it .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
so for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
they &apos;re currently making a cocktail -- an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat severe , overwhelming cases of flu .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine .
now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus .
notice these other , smaller protuberances .
these are largely hidden from the immune system .
now it turns out that these spots also don &apos;t change much when the virus mutates .
if you can cripple these with specific antibodies , you could cripple all versions of the flu .
so far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .
so if this works in humans , what we &apos;re talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn &apos;t need to change every year and would remove the threat of death .
we really could think of flu , then , as just a bad cold .
of course , the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it .
so to do that , we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and , of course , smart delivery methods .
so i want you to think back a few months ago .
in june , the world health organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years .
the u.s. government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by october 15th for the flu peak .
vaccines were promised to developing countries .
hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing .
so what happened ?
well , we first figured out how to make flu vaccines , how to produce them , in the early 1940s .
it was a slow , cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
viruses only grow in living things , and so it turned out that , for flu , chicken eggs worked really well .
for most strains , you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg .
luckily for us , we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances .
so today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
this year &apos;s swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
so , here &apos;s an alarming thought .
what if that wild bird flies by again ?
you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks , and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines .
so , dan &#91; barber &#93; , if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm , i know where to get them .
so right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains , and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
but this assumes that our factories are humming because , in 2004 , the u.s. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant .
and the process still takes more than half a year .
so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 ?
well , with the new technologies emerging now , i hope we can say definitively , &quot; yes . &quot;
imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we &apos;re currently spending now in the united states .
with a range of new technologies , we could .
here &apos;s an example : a company i &apos;m engaged with has found a specific piece of the h spike of flu that sparks the immune system .
if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they &apos;ve created a very powerful flu fighter .
this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria , e. coli .
now , as you know , bacteria reproduce quickly -- it &apos;s like making yogurt -- and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories , in a few weeks , with no eggs , for a fraction of the cost of current methods .
so here &apos;s a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies .
and , aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the e. coli method i just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved .
the developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they &apos;re leapfrogging the west .
india , mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap , billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them .
new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .
some day , perhaps soon , we &apos;ll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us .
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
luckily , this year &apos;s flu was relatively mild .
i say , &quot; luckily &quot; in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated .
so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments , we will master these and new tools of vaccinology , and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives .
no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
instead of having vaclav smil &apos;s &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
what the world needs now are these new vaccines , and we can make it happen .
thank you .
thank you .
so , the science is changing .
in your mind , seth -- i mean , you must dream about this -- what is the kind of time scale on , let &apos;s start with hiv , for a game-changing vaccine that &apos;s actually out there and usable ?
sb : the game change can come at any time , because the problem we have now is we &apos;ve shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans ; we just need a better one .
and with these types of antibodies , we know humans can make them .
so , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what &apos;s interesting is there already is some evidence that we &apos;re beginning to crack that problem .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
in your gut , do you think it &apos;s probably going to be at least another five years ?
sb : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
so i hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation , but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends .
they look good . the problem has been that , what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that &apos;s what we were comfortable with .
you also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
that &apos;s what europe is doing , so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available , but , going back to what michael specter said , the anti-vaccine crowd didn &apos;t really want that to happen .
and malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
sb : no , malaria , there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now .
it probably isn &apos;t the perfect vaccine , but it &apos;s moving along .
seth , most of us do work where every month , we produce something ; we get that kind of gratification .
you &apos;ve been slaving away at this for more than a decade , and i salute you and your colleagues for what you do .
the world needs people like you . thank you .
sb : thank you .
seth berkley : hiv and flu -- the vaccine strategy
seth berkley explains how smart advances in vaccine design , production and distribution are bringing us closer than ever to eliminating a host of global threats -- from aids to malaria to flu pandemics .
basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
and it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . so the world now is a map of connectivity .
it used to be that paris and london and new york were the largest cities .
what we have now is the end of the rise of the west . that &apos;s over .
the aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
so what &apos;s really going on ? well , villages of the world are emptying out .
the question is , why ?
and here &apos;s the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free , they said in renaissance germany . so some people go to places like shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
and these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
they &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
they have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
one-sixth of the gdp in india is coming out of mumbai .
they are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
education is the main event that can happen in cities .
what &apos;s going on in the street in mumbai ?
al gore knows . it &apos;s basically everything .
there &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . everyone works .
one-sixth of humanity is there . it &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
so here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
and here &apos;s the second punch line .
that &apos;s the news from downtown . here it is in perspective .
stars have shined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
now we &apos;re shining right back up .
thank you .
rural villages worldwide are being deserted , as billions of people flock to cities to live in teeming squatter camps and slums . stewart brand says this is a good thing . why ? it &apos;ll take you 3 minutes to find out .
well , first of all , let me thank emeka -- as a matter of fact , ted global -- for putting this conference together .
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
think african governments will put together a conference like this ?
you think the a.u. will put together a conference like this ?
even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid .
i would also like to pay homage and honor to the ted fellows june arunga , james shikwati , andrew , and the other ted fellows .
i call them the cheetah generation .
they understand what accountability and democracy is .
they &apos;re not going to wait for government to do things for them .
that &apos;s the cheetah generation , and africa &apos;s salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs .
in contrast , of course , we have the hippo generation .
the hippo generation are the ruling elites .
they are stuck in their intellectual patch .
complaining about colonialism and imperialism , they wouldn &apos;t move one foot .
if you ask them to reform the economies , they &apos;re not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo .
now , there are a lot of africans who are very angry , angry at the condition of africa .
now , we &apos;re talking about a continent that is not poor .
but the mineral wealth of africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty .
that &apos;s what makes a lot of africans very angry .
and in a way , africa is more than a tragedy , in more ways than one .
there &apos;s another enduring tragedy , and that tragedy is that there are so many people , so many governments , so many organizations who want to help the people in africa .
they don &apos;t understand .
now , we &apos;re not saying don &apos;t help africa .
but helping africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd .
it &apos;s like the blind leading the clueless .
there are certain things that we need to recognize .
africa &apos;s begging-bowl leaks .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa ?
it &apos;s taken out of africa .
look at africa &apos;s begging-bowl .
it leaks horribly .
there are people who think that we should pour more money , more aid into this bowl which leaks .
what are the leakages ?
corruption alone costs africa 148 billion dollars a year .
yes , put that aside .
capital flight out of africa , 80 billion a year .
put that aside .
let &apos;s take food imports .
every year africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food .
that &apos;s far more than the 50 billion tony blair wants to raise for africa .
now , back in the 1960s africa not only fed itself , it also exported food .
not anymore .
we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong .
you know it , i know it , but let &apos;s not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we &apos;ll spend all day here .
let &apos;s move on , and flip over to the next chapter , and that &apos;s what this conference is all about -- the next chapter .
the next chapter begins with first of all , asking ourselves this fundamental question , &quot; whom do we want to help in africa ? &quot;
there is the people , and then there is the government or leaders .
now , the previous speaker before me , idris mohammed , indicated that we &apos;ve had abysmal leadership in africa .
that characterization , in my view , is even more charitable .
i belong to an internet discussion forum , an african internet discussion forum , and i asked them , i said , &quot; since 1960 , we &apos;ve had exactly 204 african heads of state , since 1960 . &quot;
and i asked them to name me just 20 good leaders , just 20 good leaders -- you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself .
everybody mentioned nelson mandela , of course .
kwame nkrumah , nyerere , kenyatta -- somebody mentioned idi amin .
i let that pass .
my point is , they couldn &apos;t go beyond 15 .
even if they had been able to name me 20 , what does that tell you ?
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people .
and if you look at them , the slate of the post-colonial leaders -- an assortment of military fufu heads , swiss-bank socialists , crocodile liberators , vampire elites , quack revolutionaries .
now , this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries .
the second false premise that we make when we &apos;re trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that cares about its people , serves the interests of the people , and represents the people .
there is one particular quote -- a lesotho chief once said that &quot; here in lesotho , we &apos;ve got two problems : rats and the government . &quot;
what you and i understand as a government doesn &apos;t exist in many african countries .
in fact , what we call our governments are vampire states .
vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people .
government is the problem in africa .
a vampire state is the government -- -- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves , their cronies , and tribesmen and exclude everybody else .
the richest people in africa are heads-of-state and ministers , and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself .
where do they get their money ?
by creating wealth ?
no .
by raking it off the backs of their suffering people .
that &apos;s not wealth creation . it &apos;s wealth redistribution .
the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the african people , we must know where the african people are .
an african economy can be broken up into three sectors .
there is the modern sector , there is the informal sector and the traditional sector .
the modern sector is the abode of the elites .
it &apos;s the seat of government .
in many african countries the modern sector is lost .
it &apos;s dysfunctional .
it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems , which the elites themselves don &apos;t understand .
that is the source of many of africa &apos;s problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector , claiming innocent lives .
now the modern sector , of course , is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into .
more than 80 percent of ivory coast &apos;s development went into the modern sector .
the other sectors , the informal and the traditional sectors , are where you find the majority of the african people , the real people in africa . that &apos;s where you find them .
now , obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people , you go where the people are .
but that &apos;s not what we did .
as a matter of fact , we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors .
now , traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture , which is one of the reasons why africa can &apos;t feed itself , and that &apos;s why it must import food .
all right , you cannot develop africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors .
and you can &apos;t develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work .
these two sectors , let me describe to you , have their own indigenous institutions .
first one is the political system .
traditionally , africans hate governments . they hate tyranny .
if you look into their traditional systems , africans organize their states in two types .
the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous , so they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with any centralized authority .
the other ethnic groups , which did have chiefs , made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power .
in ashanti tradition , for example , the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders .
without the council the chief can &apos;t pass any law , and if the chief doesn &apos;t govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .
if not , the people will abandon the chief , go somewhere else and set up a new settlement .
and even if you look in ancient african empires , they were all organized around one particular principle -- the confederacy principle , which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority , decentralization of power .
now , this is what i have described to you .
this is part of africa &apos;s indigenous political heritage .
now , compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa .
it is a total far cry .
in the economic system in traditional africa , the means of production is privately owned .
it &apos;s owned by extended families .
you see , in the west , the basic economic and social unit is the individual .
the american will say , &quot; i am because i am , and i can damn well do anything i want , anytime . &quot;
the accent is on the &quot; i. &quot;
in africa , the africans say , &quot; i am , because we are . &quot;
the &quot; we &quot; connotes community -- the extended family system .
the extended family system pools its resources together .
they own farms . they decide what to do , what to produce .
they don &apos;t take any orders from their chiefs .
they decide what to do .
and when they produce their crops , they sell the surplus on marketplaces .
when they make a profit it is theirs to keep , not for the chief to sequester it from them .
there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent .
timbuktu was one great big market town .
kano , salaga -- they were all there .
even if you go to west africa , you notice that market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women .
so , it &apos;s quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .
the market is not alien to africa .
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism , but then after independence , all of a sudden , markets , capitalism became a western institution , and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism .
nonsense .
and even then , what kind of socialism did they practice ?
the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss-bank socialism , which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder africa &apos;s treasuries for deposit in switzerland .
that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries .
what do we do now ?
go back to africa &apos;s indigenous institutions , and this is where we charge the cheetahs to go into the informal sectors , the traditional sectors .
that &apos;s where you find the african people .
and i &apos;d like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector , about the boat-building that i , myself , tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in .
could you please show that ?
the men are going fishing in these small boats .
yes , it &apos;s an enterprise .
this is by a local ghanaian entrepreneur , using his own capital .
he &apos;s getting no assistance from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .
it means that he will be able to employ more ghanaians .
and then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy .
all that you need to do , all that the elites need to do , is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient .
now , it is not just this informal sector .
there is also traditional medicine .
80 percent of africans still rely on traditional medicine .
the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed .
now , this is an area -- i mean , there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area .
this is where we need to mobilize africans , in the diaspora especially , to invest in this .
we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora , not only to go into the traditional sectors , but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within .
we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana .
and i know that with the cheetahs , we can take africa back one village at a time .
george ayittey : africa &apos;s cheetahs versus hippos
ghanaian economist george ayittey unleashes a torrent of controlled anger toward corrupt leaders in africa -- and calls on the &quot; cheetah generation &quot; to take back the continent .
mark zuckerberg , a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed .
and the journalist was asking him , &quot; why is this so important ? &quot;
and zuckerberg said , &quot; a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa . &quot;
and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like .
so when i was growing up in a really rural area in maine , the internet meant something very different to me .
it meant a connection to the world .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
but there &apos;s this shift in how information is flowing online , and it &apos;s invisible .
so i first noticed this in a place i spend a lot of time -- my facebook page .
i &apos;m progressive , politically -- big surprise -- but i &apos;ve always gone out of my way to meet conservatives .
i like hearing what they &apos;re thinking about ; i like seeing what they link to ; i like learning a thing or two .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on , and it was noticing that , actually , i was clicking more on my liberal friends &apos; links than on my conservative friends &apos; links .
and without consulting me about it , it had edited them out .
they disappeared .
so facebook isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of invisible , algorithmic editing of the web .
google &apos;s doing it too .
if i search for something , and you search for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different search results .
even if you &apos;re logged out , one engineer told me , there are 57 signals that google looks at -- everything from what kind of computer you &apos;re on to what kind of browser you &apos;re using to where you &apos;re located -- that it uses to personally tailor your query results .
think about it for a second : there is no standard google anymore .
and you know , the funny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see .
you can &apos;t see how different your search results are from anyone else &apos;s .
but a couple of weeks ago , i asked a bunch of friends to google &quot; egypt &quot; and to send me screen shots of what they got .
so here &apos;s my friend scott &apos;s screen shot .
and here &apos;s my friend daniel &apos;s screen shot .
when you put them side-by-side , you don &apos;t even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are .
but when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable .
daniel didn &apos;t get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and this was the big story of the day at that time .
so it &apos;s not just google and facebook either .
this is something that &apos;s sweeping the web .
there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization .
yahoo news , the biggest news site on the internet , is now personalized -- different people get different things .
huffington post , the washington post , the new york times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways .
and this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see , but not necessarily what we need to see .
as eric schmidt said , &quot; it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them . &quot;
so i do think this is a problem .
and i think , if you take all of these filters together , you take all these algorithms , you get what i call a filter bubble .
and your filter bubble is your own personal , unique universe of information that you live in online .
and what &apos;s in your filter bubble depends on who you are , and it depends on what you do .
and more importantly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets edited out .
so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix .
and they were looking at the netflix queues , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses .
they enter the queue , they just zip right out .
so &quot; iron man &quot; zips right out , and &quot; waiting for superman &quot; can wait for a really long time .
what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there &apos;s this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
you know we all want to be someone who has watched &quot; rashomon , &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; ace ventura &quot; for the fourth time .
so the best editing gives us a bit of both .
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
and instead of a balanced information diet , you can end up surrounded by information junk food .
in a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society , there were these gatekeepers , the editors , and they controlled the flows of information .
and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way , and it allowed all of us to connect together , and it was awesome .
but that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
what we &apos;re seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
and the thing is that the algorithms don &apos;t yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .
so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to decide what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just keyed to relevance .
we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important -- this is what ted does -- other points of view .
and the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society .
in 1915 , it &apos;s not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities .
then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
that , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a functioning democracy if citizens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed .
it wasn &apos;t perfect , but it got us through the last century .
and so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 1915 on the web .
and we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they &apos;re writing .
i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google -- larry and sergey -- people who have helped build the web as it is , and i &apos;m grateful for that .
but we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civic responsibility .
we need you to make sure that they &apos;re transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
because i think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
we need it to connect us all together .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
and it &apos;s not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one .
eli pariser : beware online &quot; filter bubbles &quot;
as web companies strive to tailor their services to our personal tastes , there &apos;s a dangerous unintended consequence : we get trapped in a &quot; filter bubble &quot; and don &apos;t get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview . eli pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy .
thank you so much , chris . and it &apos;s truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice . i &apos;m extremely grateful .
i have been blown away by this conference , and i want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what i had to say the other night .
and i say that sincerely , partly because -- -- i need that !
put yourselves in my position !
i flew on air force two for eight years .
now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !
i &apos;ll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that &apos;s been like for me .
it &apos;s a true story -- every bit of this is true .
soon after tipper and i left the -- -- white house -- -- we were driving from our home in nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of nashville -- driving ourselves .
i know it sounds like a little thing to you , but -- -- i looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me .
there was no motorcade back there .
you &apos;ve heard of phantom limb pain ?
this was a rented ford taurus . it was dinnertime , and we started looking for a place to eat .
we were on i-40 . we got to exit 238 , lebanon , tennessee .
we got off the exit , started looking for a -- we found a shoney &apos;s restaurant .
low-cost family restaurant chain , for those of you who don &apos;t know it .
we went in and sat down at the booth , and the waitress came over , made a big commotion over tipper .
she took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s former vice president al gore and his wife tipper . &quot;
and the man said , &quot; he &apos;s come down a long way , hasn &apos;t he ? &quot;
the very next day , continuing a totally true story , i got on a g-5 to fly to africa to make a speech in nigeria , in the city of lagos , on the topic of energy .
i began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in nashville .
i told it pretty much the same way i &apos;ve just shared it with you : tipper and i were driving ourselves , shoney &apos;s , low-cost family restaurant chain , what the man said -- they laughed .
i gave my speech , then went back out to the airport to fly back home .
i fell asleep on the plane , until during the middle of the night , we landed on the azores islands for refueling .
i woke up , they opened the door , i went out to get some fresh air , and i looked and there was a man running across the runway .
and he was waving a piece of paper , and he was yelling , &quot; call washington ! call washington ! &quot;
and i thought to myself , in the middle of the night , in the middle of the atlantic , what in the world could be wrong in washington ?
then i remembered it could be a bunch of things .
but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in nigeria had already written a story about my speech .
and it had already been printed in cities all across the united states of america -- it was printed in monterey , i checked . and the story began , &quot; former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday , &apos; my wife tipper and i have opened a low-cost family restaurant , named shoney &apos;s , and we are running it ourselves . &apos; &quot; before i could get back to u.s. soil , david letterman and jay leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef &apos;s hat , tipper was saying , &quot; one more burger , with fries ! &quot;
three days later , i got a nice , long , handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague bill clinton saying , &quot; congratulations on the new restaurant , al ! &quot;
we like to celebrate each other &apos;s successes in life .
i was going to talk about information ecology .
but i was thinking that since i plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to ted , that maybe i could talk about that another time .
i want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on .
what can you do about the climate crisis ? i want to start with -- i &apos;m going to show some new images , and i &apos;m going to recapitulate just four or five .
now , the slide show . i update the slide show every time i give it .
i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
it &apos;s like beachcombing , you know ? every time the tide comes in and out , you find some more shells .
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in january .
this is just for the united states of america . historical average for january is 31 degrees . last month was 39.5 degrees .
but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these .
first of all , this is where we &apos;re projected to go with the u.s. contribution to global warming , under business as usual . efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit . efficiency and conservation : it &apos;s not a cost ; it &apos;s a profit . the sign is wrong .
it &apos;s not negative ; it &apos;s positive . these are investments that pay for themselves .
but they are also very effective in deflecting our path .
cars and trucks -- i talked about that in the slideshow , but i want you to put it in perspective .
it &apos;s an easy , visible target of concern , and it should be , but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks .
cars and trucks are very significant , and we have the lowest standards in the world , and so we should address that . but it &apos;s part of the puzzle .
other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks !
renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference , and with what vinod , and john doerr , and others , many of you here -- a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it .
carbon capture and sequestration -- that &apos;s what ccs stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe .
not quite there yet .
ok . now , what can you do ? reduce emissions in your home .
most of these expenditures are also profitable .
insulation , better design , buy green electricity where you can .
i mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid . use light rail .
figure out some of the other options that are much better . it &apos;s important .
be a green consumer . you have choices with everything you buy , between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis .
consider this . make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life .
those of you who are good at branding , i &apos;d love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people .
it is easier than you think . it really is .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
it means : reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make , and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced . and what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.
you can very precisely calculate what your co2 emissions are , and then you will be given options to reduce .
and by the time the movie comes out in may , this will be updated to 2.0 and we will have click-through purchases of offsets .
next , consider making your business carbon-neutral . again , some of us have done that , and it &apos;s not as hard as you think . integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations , whether you are from the technology , or entertainment , or design and architecture community .
invest sustainably . majora mentioned this .
listen , if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance , don &apos;t ever again complain about quarterly report ceo management .
over time , people do what you pay them to do . and if they judge how much they &apos;re going to get paid on your capital that they &apos;ve invested , based on the short-term returns , you &apos;re going to get short-term decisions .
a lot more to be said about that .
become a catalyst of change . teach others ; learn about it ; talk about it .
the movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago , except it &apos;s a lot more entertaining . and it comes out in may .
many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it .
consider sending somebody to nashville . pick well .
and i am personally going to train people to give this slideshow , re-purposed , with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach , and -- it &apos;s not just the slides , it &apos;s what they mean . and it &apos;s how they link together .
and so i &apos;m going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it , en masse , in communities all across the country , and we &apos;re going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge .
working with larry lessig , it will be , somewhere in that process , posted with tools and limited-use copyrights , so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way .
where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm &apos;s length from politics ?
it doesn &apos;t mean that if you are a republican that i &apos;m trying to convince you to be a democrat . we need republicans as well . this used to be a bipartisan issue , and i know that in this group it really is . become politically active .
make our democracy work the way it &apos;s supposed to work .
support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions , global warming pollution , and trading it . here &apos;s why : as long as the united states is out of the world system , it &apos;s not a closed system .
once it becomes a closed system , with u.s. participation , then everybody who &apos;s on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
once it &apos;s a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided . the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this .
help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring .
we have to change the minds of the american people . because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done .
it &apos;s now repetition of short , hot-button , 30-second , 28-second television ads .
we have to buy a lot of those ads .
let &apos;s rebrand global warming , as many of you have suggested .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
somebody said the test we &apos;re facing now , a scientist told me , is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination .
again , the republicans here , this shouldn &apos;t be partisan .
you have more influence than some of us who are democrats do .
this is an opportunity . not just this , but connected to the ideas that are here , to bring more coherence to them .
we are one .
with the same humor and humanity he exuded in &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; an inconvenient truth , &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; al gore spells out 15 ways that individuals can address climate change immediately , from buying a hybrid to inventing a new , hotter &quot; brand name &quot; for global warming .
this is the ocean as i used to know it .
and i find that since i &apos;ve been in the gulf a couple of times , i really kind of am traumatized because whenever i look at the ocean now , no matter where i am , even where i know none of the oil has gone , i sort of see slicks , and i &apos;m finding that i &apos;m very much haunted by it .
but what i want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context , not just about the oil eruption , but what it means and why it has happened .
first , just a little bit about me .
i &apos;m basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since i was a little kid , and because i did , i wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that i so loved .
and now i mainly write books about how the ocean is changing , and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly .
now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on , that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it .
it &apos;s like you dipped a marble in water .
and the same thing with the atmosphere : if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball , you would get that little sphere of gas on the right .
so we live on the most fragile , little soap bubble you can imagine , a very sacred soap bubble , but one that is very , very easy to affect .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fuels , have changed the atmosphere greatly .
we &apos;re warming the climate .
beyond warming , we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so , and already affecting animals .
now in the laboratory , if you take a clam and you put it in the ph that is -- not 8.1 , which is the normal ph of seawater -- but 7.5 , it dissolves in about three days .
if you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1 , put it in a ph of 7.7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies .
and already , commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places .
coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem .
so this really matters .
now , let &apos;s take a little tour around the gulf a little bit .
one of the things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf : they are really , really aquatic people .
and they can handle water .
they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
when the water goes down , they know what to do .
but when it &apos;s something other than water , and their water habitat changes , they don &apos;t have many options .
in fact , those entire communities really don &apos;t have many options .
they can &apos;t go and work in the local hotel business because there isn &apos;t one in their community .
if you go to the gulf and you look around , you do see a lot of oil .
you see a lot of oil on the ocean .
you see a lot of oil on the shoreline .
if you go to the site of the blowout , it looks pretty unbelievable .
it looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car , and you just dumped it in the ocean .
and one of the really most incredible things , i think , is that there &apos;s nobody out there trying to collect it parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic .
you go in along the shore , you can find it everywhere .
it &apos;s really messy .
and they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach .
they &apos;re not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand in a 50-gallon plastic bag .
they have thousands and thousands of plastic bags .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do with all that stuff .
meanwhile , there are still people trying to use the beach .
they don &apos;t see the little , tiny sign their kids are in the water ; they &apos;re getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals . it &apos;s a mess .
if you go to the place where the oil has been a while , it &apos;s an even bigger mess .
and there &apos;s basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
they are very hardworking people .
all they know about life is they get up in the morning , and if their engine starts , they go to work .
they always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the gulf .
they &apos;re finding that their world is really collapsing .
and so you can see , literally , signs of their shock , signs of their outrage , signs of their anger , and signs of their grief .
these are the things that you can see .
there &apos;s a lot you can &apos;t see , also , underwater .
what &apos;s going on underwater ?
well , some people say there are oil plumes .
some people say there are not oil plumes .
and congressman markey asks , you know , &quot; is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes ? &quot;
but i couldn &apos;t take a submarine ride -- especially between the time i knew i was coming here and today -- so i had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the gulf of mexico .
so this is the gulf of mexico , sparkling place full of fish .
i created a little oil spill in the gulf of mexico .
and you add a little energy from the wind and the waves , and you get a big mess , a big mess that you can &apos;t possibly clean , you can &apos;t touch , you can &apos;t extract and , i think most importantly -- this is what i think -- you can &apos;t see it .
i think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess , that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream .
but as many people have said , there &apos;s a large attempt to suppress what &apos;s going on .
personally , i think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body , because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene .
but you can see it .
you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface , and then it is attacked , because they don &apos;t want the evidence , in my opinion .
okay .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
so do sea turtles .
when it breaks up , it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria .
turtles eat it . it gets in the gills of fish .
these guys have to swim around through it .
i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here .
a writer named ted williams called me , and he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw , because he &apos;s writing an article for audubon magazine .
he said that he had been in the gulf a little while ago -- like about a week ago -- and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what &apos;s going on .
that guide &apos;s entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
he has no bookings left .
everybody wanted their deposit back . everybody is fleeing .
that &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
but he told ted that on the last day he went out , a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat , and it was splattering oil out its blowhole .
and he moved away because it was his last fishing trip , and he knew that the dolphins scare fish .
he said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that .
and he felt that -- he felt that it was coming to ask for help . sorry .
now , in the exxon valdez spill , about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months .
their numbers have never recovered .
it &apos;s going to take longer for some things .
and some things , i think , will probably come back a little faster .
the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year .
so the gulf is a really important piece of water -- more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean .
these tuna swim the entire ocean .
they get in the gulf stream . they go all the way to europe .
when it comes time to spawn , they come inside , and these two tuna that were tagged , you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick .
they &apos;re probably having , at the very least , a catastrophic spawning season this year .
i &apos;m hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water .
but these are really high-performance athletic animals .
i don &apos;t know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;ll affect the adults .
if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s certainly affecting their eggs and larvae , i would certainly think .
but if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done to this species through overfishing over many decades .
so while the oil spill , the leak , the eruption , is a catastrophe , i think it &apos;s important to keep in mind that we &apos;ve done a lot to affect what &apos;s in the ocean for a very , very long time .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s been okay .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .
if you look around at the birds , there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentrate in the gulf at certain times of the year , but then leave .
so for instance , most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds .
they were all on the gulf in may , while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places .
they breed in the high arctic , and they winter down in southern south america .
but they concentrate in the gulf and then fan out all across the arctic .
i saw birds that breed in greenland in the gulf , so this is a hemispheric issue .
the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways .
the biological effects are certainly hemispheric .
i think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples of total unpreparedness that i can even think of .
even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor , at least they shot back .
and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do .
there was nothing ready , and , you know , as we can see by what they &apos;re doing .
mainly what they &apos;re doing is booms and dispersants .
the booms are absolutely not made for open water .
they don &apos;t even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated .
they get near shore . look at these two boats .
that one on the right is called fishing fool .
and i think , you know , that &apos;s a great name for boats that think that they &apos;re going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the gulf right now with oil at the surface .
the dispersants make the oil go right under the booms .
the booms are only about 13 inches in diameter .
so it &apos;s just absolutely crazy .
here are shrimp boats employed .
there are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets .
you can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom .
all they &apos;re doing is stirring it .
it &apos;s just ridiculous .
also , for all the shoreline that has booms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline -- all of the shoreline that has booms , there &apos;s adjacent shoreline that doesn &apos;t have any booms .
there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them .
and that lower photo , that &apos;s a bird colony that has been boomed .
everybody &apos;s trying to protect the bird colonies there .
well , as an ornithologist , i can tell you that birds fly , and that -- and that booming a bird colony doesn &apos;t do it ; it doesn &apos;t do it .
these birds make a living by diving into the water .
in fact , really what i think they should do , if anything -- they &apos;re trying so hard to protect those nests -- actually , if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave , and that would be better for them this year .
as far as cleaning them , i don &apos;t mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds .
it &apos;s really , really important that we express our compassion .
i think that &apos;s the most important thing that people have , is compassion .
it &apos;s really important to get those images and to show it .
it &apos;s like taking somebody out of a burning building , treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building , because the oil is still gushing .
i refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident .
i think that this is the result of gross negligence .
b.p. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could .
and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that &apos;s supposed to be our government , protecting us .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states -- you know , if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for , and who has gotten above the laws .
now there are things that we can do in the future .
it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making 30,000 holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil , oil might start coming out of one of them .
and you &apos;d have some idea of what to do .
that &apos;s certainly one of the things we need to do .
but i think we have to understand where this leak really started from .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
so i think that the oil blowout , the bank bailout , the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause .
we still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people .
and even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them .
but in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least 30 years , there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from , buying the government out from under us .
you can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of america , and even thomas jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country .
okay , people who say they &apos;re conservative , if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic , they would tell these corporations to go to hell .
that &apos;s what it would really mean to be conservative .
so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it &apos;s our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost .
i think there are signs of hope .
the glass-steagall act -- which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen , and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts -- that was put in effect in 1933 , was systematically destroyed .
now there &apos;s a mood to put some of that stuff back in place , but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed .
so it &apos;s a continued fight .
it &apos;s a historic moment right now .
we &apos;re either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the gulf , or we will make the moment we need out of this , as many people have noted today .
there &apos;s certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this .
we &apos;ve been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling .
the first offshore wells were called whales .
we emptied the ocean of the whales at that time .
now are we stuck with this ?
ever since we lived in caves , every time we wanted any energy , we lit something on fire , and that is still what we &apos;re doing .
we &apos;re still lighting something on fire every time we want energy .
and people say we can &apos;t have clean energy because it &apos;s too expensive .
who says it &apos;s too expensive ?
people who sell us fossil fuels .
we &apos;ve been here before with energy , and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery .
energy is always a moral issue .
it &apos;s an issue that is moral right now .
it &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
carl safina : the oil spill &apos;s unseen culprits , victims
the gulf oil spill dwarfs comprehension , but we know this much : it &apos;s bad . carl safina scrapes out the facts in this blood-boiling cross-examination , arguing that the consequences will stretch far beyond the gulf -- and many so-called solutions are making the situation worse . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so my name is taylor wilson .
i am 17 years old and i am a nuclear physicist , which may be a little hard to believe , but i am .
and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point , that the bridge that t. boone pickens talked about will get us to .
so nuclear fusion is our energy future .
and the second point , making the case that kids can really change the world .
so you may ask -- you may ask me , well how do you know what our energy future is ?
well i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old .
that is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
now most of you are probably saying , well there &apos;s no such thing as nuclear fusion .
well it doesn &apos;t break even .
it doesn &apos;t produce more energy out than i put in , but it still does some pretty cool stuff .
and i assembled this in my garage , and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada , reno .
and it slams together deuterium , which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it .
so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that &apos;s going on inside the sun .
and i &apos;m slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together , and in the process it has some byproducts , and i utilize those byproducts .
so this previous year , i won the intel international science and engineering fair .
i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has .
for hundreds of dollars , i &apos;ve developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars .
i built this in my garage .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities i &apos;ve developed a device that , on a very small scale , can produce these isotopes .
that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor .
oh , by the way , i make yellowcake in my garage , so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians .
so maybe i don &apos;t want to admit to that .
this is me at cern in geneva , switzerland , which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world .
and this is me with president obama , showing him my homeland security research .
so in about seven years of doing nuclear research , i started out with a dream to make a &quot; star in a jar , &quot; a star in my garage , and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world , and i think other kids can too .
taylor wilson : yup , i built a nuclear fusion reactor
taylor wilson believes nuclear fusion is a solution to our future energy needs , and that kids can change the world . and he knows something about both of those : when he was 14 , he built a working fusion reactor in his parents &apos; garage . now 17 , he takes the stage at short notice to tell his story .
we live in in a remarkable time , the age of genomics .
your sequence and mine are slightly different .
that &apos;s why we look different .
i &apos;ve got brown eyes ; you might have blue or gray .
but it &apos;s not just skin-deep .
the headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases , maybe even shape our personality , or give us mental disorders .
our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies .
and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
what do you guys think ?
are you more than your genes ?
yes ?
i think some people agree with me .
i think we should make a statement .
i think we should say it all together .
all right : &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
everybody : i am more than my genes .
sebastian seung : what am i ?
i am my connectome .
now , since you guys are really great , maybe you can humor me and say this all together too .
right . all together now .
everybody : i am my connectome .
ss : that sounded great .
you know , you guys are so great , you don &apos;t even know what a connectome is , and you &apos;re willing to play along with me .
well , so far only one connectome is known , that of this tiny worm .
its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons .
and in the 1970s and &apos; 80s , a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons .
in this diagram , every node is a neuron , and every line is a connection .
this is the connectome of the worm c. elegans .
your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections .
there &apos;s a diagram like this for your brain , but there &apos;s no way it would fit on this slide .
your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters .
that &apos;s a lot of information .
we don &apos;t know for sure , but there are theories .
since the 19th century , neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories -- the information that makes you , you -- maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain &apos;s neurons .
and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity -- maybe your personality and your intellect -- maybe they &apos;re also encoded in the connections between your neurons .
and so now you can see why i proposed this hypothesis : i am my connectome .
i didn &apos;t ask you to chant it because it &apos;s true ; i just want you to remember it .
and in fact , we don &apos;t know if this hypothesis is correct , because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it .
finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor .
and to find the connectomes of brains more like our own , we need more sophisticated technologies , that are automated , that will speed up the process of finding connectomes .
and in the next few minutes , i &apos;ll tell you about some of these technologies , which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators .
now you &apos;ve probably seen pictures of neurons before .
you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes .
they extend long and delicate branches , and in short , they look like trees .
but this is just a single neuron .
so let &apos;s meet bobby kasthuri , who works in the laboratory of jeff lichtman at harvard university .
bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain .
and we &apos;re zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times to obtain the resolution , so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time .
except , you still may not really recognize them , and that &apos;s because we have to work in three dimensions .
if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three-dimensional image .
and still , you may not see the branches .
so we start at the top , and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red , and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice .
and we keep on doing that , slice after slice .
if we continue through the entire stack , we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron .
and we can do that for another neuron in green .
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations , and these are what are called synapses .
let &apos;s zoom in on one synapse , and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron .
you should see small circles -- these are called vesicles .
they contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter .
and so when the green neuron wants to communicate , it wants to send a message to the red neuron , it spits out neurotransmitter .
at the synapse , the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone .
so you see how to find a synapse .
how can we find an entire connectome ?
well , we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse .
if we can do that throughout all the images , we could find a connectome .
now , at this point , you &apos;ve learned the basics of neurons and synapses .
according to this self-help book , guys brains are like waffles ; they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes .
girls &apos; brains are like spaghetti ; everything in their life is connected to everything else .
you guys are laughing , but you know , this book changed my life .
but seriously , what &apos;s wrong with this ?
you already know enough to tell me -- what &apos;s wrong with this statement ?
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a guy or girl , everyone &apos;s brains are like spaghetti .
or maybe really , really fine capellini with branches .
just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate , one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches .
one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons , because there can be synapses at these points of contact .
by now , you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is .
i assure you , this is very tiny . it &apos;s just six microns on a side .
and you can tell that , really , only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube .
and a neuron , well , that &apos;s smaller than brain .
and that &apos;s just a mouse brain -- it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human brain .
so when show my friends this , sometimes they &apos;ve told me , &quot; you know , sebastian , you should just give up .
neuroscience is hopeless . &quot;
because if you look at a brain with your naked eye , you don &apos;t really see how complex it is , but when you use a microscope , finally the hidden complexity is revealed .
in the 17th century , the mathematician and philosopher , blaise pascal , wrote of his dread of the infinite , his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space .
and , as a scientist , i &apos;m not supposed to talk about my feelings -- too much information , professor .
but may i ?
i feel curiosity , and i feel wonder , but at times i have also felt despair .
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?
how could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this ?
and yet , i persist in this quixotic endeavor .
and indeed , these days i harbor new hopes .
someday , a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images .
and some day , artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome .
i do not know , but i hope that i will live to see that day , because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time .
it will take the work of generations to succeed .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we &apos;re aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i am my connectome .
for now , let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis , that it &apos;s actually worth taking seriously .
as you grow during childhood and age during adulthood , your personal identity changes slowly .
likewise , every connectome changes over time .
what kinds of changes happen ?
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they can lose old ones .
second question : what causes these changes ?
well , it &apos;s true .
to some extent , they are programmed by your genes .
but that &apos;s not the whole story , because there are signals , electrical signals , that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch .
these signals are called neural activity .
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts , feelings and perceptions , our mental experiences .
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change .
and if you put those two facts together , it means that your experiences can change your connectome .
the connectome is where nature meets nurture .
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .
what &apos;s in this picture ?
a cool and refreshing stream of water , you say .
do not forget that groove in the earth called the stream bed .
without it , the water would not know in which direction to flow .
and with the stream , i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity .
neural activity is constantly changing .
it &apos;s like the water of the stream ; it never sits still .
the connections of the brain &apos;s neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows .
and so the connectome is like bed of the stream ; but the metaphor is richer than that , because it &apos;s true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water , but over long timescales , the water also reshapes the bed of the stream .
and as i told you just now , neural activity can change the connectome .
and if you &apos;ll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights , i will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think -- of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
neural activity is its water , and the connectome is its bed .
so let &apos;s return from the heights of metaphor and return to science .
suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work .
how will we go about testing the hypothesis &quot; i am my connectome ? &quot;
well , i propose a direct test .
let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes .
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements , like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .
according to a theory that dates back to the 19th century , such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain .
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements .
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes .
but it won &apos;t be easy , because they &apos;re not going to look like this .
they &apos;re going to be scrambled up .
so we &apos;ll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain .
and if we can do that , the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall .
and if that were successful , that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome .
what a mess -- have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this ?
i hope not .
but if you have , you know it &apos;s very easy to make a mistake .
the branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain .
i &apos;ll give you a hint . it &apos;s a big number .
i estimate , millions of miles , all packed in your skull .
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain .
and indeed , the popular press loves headlines like , &quot; anorexic brains are wired differently , &quot; or &quot; autistic brains are wired differently . &quot;
these are plausible claims , but in truth , we can &apos;t see the brain &apos;s wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true .
and so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis-wiring of the brain , to see mental disorders in connectomes .
sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication .
philosophers know this game very well .
if you believe that i am my connectome , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome .
i mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species .
one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics .
should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality , calling them fools ?
or will they someday chuckle over our graves ?
i don &apos;t know -- i prefer to test their beliefs , scientifically .
i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain .
we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing .
the question is : has that damage erased the connectome ?
if it has , there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains .
resurrection might succeed for the body , but not for the mind .
on the other hand , if the connectome is still intact , we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily .
i &apos;ve described a quest that begins in the world of the very small , and propels us to the world of the far future .
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history .
as we evolved from our ape-like ancestors on the african savanna , what distinguished us was our larger brains .
we have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains .
i believe that this voyage of self-discovery is not just for scientists , but for all of us .
and i &apos;m grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today .
thank you .
sebastian seung : i am my connectome
sebastian seung is mapping a massively ambitious new model of the brain that focuses on the connections between each neuron . he calls it our &quot; connectome , &quot; and it &apos;s as individual as our genome -- and understanding it could open a new way to understand our brains and our minds .
zach kaplan : keith and i lead a research team .
we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties . over the last three years , we found over 200 of these things , and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted .
of these six , the first one that we &apos;re going to talk about is in the black envelope you &apos;re holding .
keith schacht : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this .
we spent a long time thinking about why this is , and it &apos;s just recently that we realized : it &apos;s when we see something unexpected , it changes our understanding of the way things work .
as you &apos;re seeing this gel magnet for the first time , if you assume that all magnets had to be hard , then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work .
zk : now , it &apos;s important to understand what the unexpected properties are .
but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible , we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world .
so , a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors .
if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn &apos;t make a loud noise , and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed .
imagine taking the same material , but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker .
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf .
for me , i really love this idea .
if you come to my apartment and see my closet , i &apos;m sure you &apos;d figure out why : it &apos;s a mess .
ks : seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant , what the potential is .
but we &apos;ve found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference .
zk : it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l.a. , and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola .
he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company , the directors bureau .
as we were talking , roman told us that he &apos;s kind of an inventor on the side .
and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you &apos;re holding in your hand -- and you know , we shared the same ideas . and you could see it in his face : roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder ; he opens it up and keith and i look in , and he starts showing us concepts that he &apos;s been working on .
these things just get him really excited . and so we &apos;re looking at these concepts , and we were just like , whoa , this guy &apos;s good .
because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .
when we were going in the car back to the airport , we were thinking : why was this so powerful ?
and as we thought about it more , we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience , just as if you saw it on tv . so , for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future .
inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast , so tall , that when you hit the bottom , it uses brakes to stop .
aqua rocket : coming this summer .
ks : now , we showed the concept to a few people before this , and they asked us , when &apos;s it coming out ?
so i just wanted to let you know , it &apos;s not actually coming out , just the concept is .
zk : so now , when we dream up these concepts , it &apos;s important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint .
so i just want to quickly explain how this would work .
this is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
the gel that you &apos;re holding would be lining the bottom of the board .
now this is important for two reasons .
one : the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that , if it were to hit the rider in the head , it wouldn &apos;t injure him .
in addition , you can see from the diagram on the right , the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .
so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you &apos;re going down .
the force of the water rushing down , in addition to that repulsion force , would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market .
it &apos;s because of this that you need the magnetic braking system .
when you get to the very bottom of the slide -- -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube .
and i &apos;m going to kick it to keith to explain why that &apos;s important from a technical standpoint .
ks : so i &apos;m sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal , it &apos;s not a magnetic material . but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
now , i &apos;m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet &apos;s falling , the greater the stopping force .
zk : now , our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole , and i have it right here in my pocket .
there &apos;re a few different versions of it .
they can be made to automatically roll up , or they can be made stable , like zach &apos;s , to hold any position in between .
zk : as we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these , or how they &apos;re being applied currently -- he was telling us that , in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then , when they &apos;re out on the field , erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base .
in our brainstorms , we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal : so at the end of the game , you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag .
ks : now , the interesting thing about this is , you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .
so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this .
i clean my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house -- i do it that way .
i &apos;d make my very own walking stick .
i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree .
some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use .
i would make a spear that , when you went deep sea diving , you could catch the fish really fast , and then roll it back up , and you could swim easier ... yeah .
zk : now , for our next technology we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , and so we need a volunteer from the audience .
you sir , come on up .
come on up . tell everybody your name .
steve jurvetson : steve .
zk : it &apos;s steve . all right steve , now , follow me .
we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign .
right there . that &apos;s great .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
ks : no , not yet .
zk : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
ks : little bit -- that &apos;s perfect , just perfect .
now , zach , we &apos;re going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future .
so , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . go ahead .
sj : it &apos;s cold .
ks : now the reason it &apos;s cold is that &apos;s it &apos;s not actually water loaded into these squirt guns -- it &apos;s a dry liquid developed by 3m .
it &apos;s perfectly clear , it &apos;s odorless , it &apos;s colorless .
it &apos;s so safe you could drink this stuff .
and the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water .
all right , well thanks for coming up .
zk : wait , wait , steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends .
sj : excellent , thank you .
ks : thanks for coming up . let &apos;s give him a big round of applause .
so what &apos;s the significance of this dry liquid ?
early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer .
now , the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we &apos;d damage the electronics , that we &apos;d get him wet , that we &apos;d hurt the books or the computers . it works because it &apos;s non-conductive .
so you can see here , you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn &apos;t cause any damage .
you can circulate it to draw the heat away .
but today it &apos;s most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid .
again , it &apos;s perfectly safe for people . it puts out the fires , doesn &apos;t hurt anything .
but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game . so during halftime , it could rain down on the players , cool everyone down , and in a matter of minutes it would dry . wouldn &apos;t hurt the court .
zk : our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical . one of their r &amp; amp ; d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
we have a video to show you .
ks : so you see there , it didn &apos;t bounce back . now , this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing .
now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil .
shape-retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil , and it holds its place . contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back .
zk : for example , you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist , but doesn &apos;t use a buckle .
taking it a little further , if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet , and then you could embed it in a cloth : so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table , so that way on a windy day it wouldn &apos;t blow away .
for our next technology , it &apos;s hard to observe the unexpected property by itself , because it &apos;s an ink .
so , we &apos;ve prepared a video to show it applied to paper .
ks : as this paper is bending , the resistance of the ink changes .
so with simple electronics , you can detect how much the page is being bent .
now , to think about the potential for this , think of all the places ink is supplied : on business cards , on the back of cereal boxes , board games . any place you use ink , you could change the way you interact with it .
zk : so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .
this could totally change the way that you interface with paper .
you see the dark line on the side and the top . as you turn the pages of the book , the book can actually detect what page you &apos;re on , based on the curvature of the pages .
in addition , if you were to fold in one of the corners , then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes .
ks : for our last technology , we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .
old milk carton : oh yeah , it smells good .
who are you ?
new milk carton : i &apos;m new milk .
omc : i used to smell like you .
fresh watch , from inventables dairy farms .
packaging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
zk : now , this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken suslick and neil rakow , of the university of illinois .
ks : now the way it works : there &apos;s a matrix of color dyes .
so the smell of vanilla , that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow . this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells .
but like in the milk commercial , if you know what odor you want to detect , then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor .
zk : right . it was that that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself , and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible , beyond just detecting spoiled food . it &apos;s really where the significance of it lies .
his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn , how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene ?
and he kind of comically explained that time after time , what the firemen would say is : they would rush to the scene of the crime ; they would look around ; if there were no dead policemen , it was ok to go .
i mean , this is a true story . they &apos;re using policemen as canaries .
but more seriously , they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans , and say if it &apos;s safe for the firemen .
in addition , he &apos;s spun off a company from the university called chemsensing , where they &apos;re working on medical equipment .
so , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .
currently , they &apos;re using a method of trial and error , but this could tell you precisely what disease you have .
ks : so that was the six we had for you today , but i hope you &apos;re starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world . prior to seeing this , we would have assumed : a 10-foot pole couldn &apos;t fit in your pocket ; something as inexpensive as ink couldn &apos;t sense the way paper is being bent ; every one of these things -- and we &apos;re constantly trying to find more .
zk : this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s obvious to you now , but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why . i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson , over downstairs by the escalators , and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box , one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand -- the sand that doesn &apos;t get wet . he said that he was playing with it with his son .
and you know , his son was mesmerized , because he would dunk it in the water , he would take it out and it was bone dry . a few weeks later , he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother &apos;s hair , and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair .
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said , &quot; look , hydrophobic string . &quot;
i mean , after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me .
ks : thank you .
zach kaplan + keith schacht : toys and materials from the future
the inventables guys , zach kaplan and keith schacht , demo some amazing new materials and how we might use them . look for squishy magnets , odor-detecting ink , &quot; dry &quot; liquid and a very surprising 10-foot pole .
i went to spain a few months ago and i had the best foie gras of my life .
because what i saw , i &apos;m convinced , is the future of cooking .
ridiculous , right ?
foie gras and the future of cooking .
there &apos;s not a food today that &apos;s more maligned than foie gras , right ?
i mean , it &apos;s crucified .
it was outlawed in chicago for a while .
it &apos;s pending here in california , and just recently in new york .
it &apos;s like if you &apos;re a chef and you put it on your menu , you risk being attacked .
really , it happened here in san francisco to a famous chef .
i &apos;m not saying that there &apos;s not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras .
the reasons usually just boil down to the gavage , which is the force feeding .
basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat .
more grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime .
its liver expands by eight times .
suffice to say it &apos;s like -- it &apos;s not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming .
the problem for us chefs is that it &apos;s so freakin &apos; delicious .
i mean , i love the stuff .
it is fatty , it &apos;s sweet , it &apos;s silky , it &apos;s unctuous .
it makes everything else you put it with taste incredible .
can we produce a menu that &apos;s delicious without foie gras ?
yes , sure .
you can also bike the tour de france without steroids , right ?
and for good reason .
so several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras .
natural foie gras .
what &apos;s natural about foie gras ?
to take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall , geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter .
and the rest of the year they &apos;re free to roam around eduardo &apos;s land and eat what they want .
so no gavage , no force feeding , no factory-like conditions , no cruelty .
and it &apos;s shockingly not a new idea .
his great-granddad started -- patería de sousa -- in 1812 .
and they &apos;ve been doing it quietly ever since .
that is until last year , when eduardo won the coup de coeur , the coveted french gastronomic prize .
it &apos;s like the olympics of food products .
he placed first for his foie gras .
big , big problem .
as he said to me , that really pissed the french off .
he said it sort of gleefully .
it was all over the papers .
i read about it . it was in le monde .
&quot; spanish chef accused ... &quot; -- and the french accused him .
&quot; spanish chef accused of cheating . &quot;
they accused him of paying off the judges .
huh , amazing .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
couldn &apos;t find a shred of evidence .
now , look at the guy .
he doesn &apos;t look like a guy who &apos;s paying off french judges for his foie gras .
so that died down , and very soon afterward , new controversy .
he shouldn &apos;t win because it &apos;s not foie gras .
it &apos;s not foie gras because it &apos;s not gavage .
there &apos;s no force feeding .
so by definition , he &apos;s lying and should be disqualified .
as funny as it sounds , articulating it now and reading about it -- actually , if we had talked about it before this controversy , i would have said , &quot; that &apos;s kind of true . &quot;
you know , foie gras by definition , force feeding , it &apos;s gavage , and that &apos;s what you get when you want foie gras .
that is , until i went to eduardo &apos;s farm in extremadura , 50 miles north of seville , right on the portugal border .
i saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time , like everything beautiful in nature , is utterly simple .
and he said to me , really from the first moment , my life &apos;s work is to give the geese what they want .
he repeated that about 50 times in the two days i was with him .
i &apos;m just here to give the geese what they want .
actually , when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass .
amazing .
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goose whisperer .
and when i was speaking to him , you know , i thought , like i &apos;m speaking to you now , right , but sort of in the middle of my questions , my excited questions , because the more i got to know him and his system , the more exciting this whole idea became .
he kept going like this to me .
i &apos;m talking a little too aggressively , whatever , so you know , i slowed down .
and finally , by the end of the day i was like , ed-uar-do , you know like this ?
but he was still going like this .
i was speaking too loudly .
so i hushed my voice .
i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper .
and amazingly , the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around -- &quot; get the hell away from this kid ! &quot; -- when i lowered my voice , they all came right up to us .
right up to us , like right up to here .
right along the fence line .
and fence line was amazing in itself .
the fence -- like this conception of fence that we have it &apos;s totally backward with him .
the electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside .
he rewired it . he invented it .
i &apos;ve never seen it . have you ?
you fence in animals . you electrify the inside .
he doesn &apos;t .
he electrifies only the outside .
why ?
because he said to me that he felt like the geese -- and he proved this actually , not just a conceit , he proved this -- the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks .
even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with figs and everything else .
he felt like they felt manipulated .
so he got rid of the electricity , he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside , so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators .
they ate , and he showed me on a chart , how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers .
the landscape is incredible .
i mean , his farm is incredible .
it really is the garden of eden .
there &apos;s figs and everything else there for the taking .
and the irony of ironies is because extremadura , the area -- what does extremadura mean ?
extra hard land , right ?
extra difficult . extra hard .
but over four generations , he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu .
upgrades the life for these geese .
and they are allowed to take whatever they want .
another irony , the double irony is that on the figs and the olives , eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras .
he doesn &apos;t care .
he lets them take what they want and he says , &quot; usually , it &apos;s about 50 percent . they &apos;re very fair . &quot;
the other 50 percent , he takes and he sells and he makes money on them .
part of the income for his farm .
a big part of his income for his farm .
but he never controls it .
they get what they want , they leave the rest for me and i sell it .
his biggest obstacle , really , was the marketplace , which demands these days bright yellow foie gras .
that &apos;s how i &apos;ve been trained .
you want to look and see what good foie gras is , it &apos;s got to be bright yellow .
well , because he doesn &apos;t force feed , because he doesn &apos;t gavage tons of corn , his livers were pretty grey .
or they were .
but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush .
the lupin bush , it &apos;s all around extremadura .
he let it go to seed , he took the seeds , he planted it on his 30 acres , all around .
and the geese love the lupin bush .
not for the bush , but for the seeds .
and when they eat the seeds , their foie gras turns yellow .
radioactive yellow .
bright yellow .
of the highest quality foie gras yellow i &apos;ve ever seen .
so i &apos;m listening to all this , you know , and i &apos;m like , is this guy for real ? is he making some of this up ?
is he like , you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything , and it was always nature .
it was never him .
and i was like , you know , i always get a little , like , weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves .
because , really , they want you to look at themselves , right ?
but he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape .
so it &apos;s like , here i am , i &apos;m on the fence about this guy , but increasingly , eating up his every word .
and we &apos;re sitting there , and i hear &#91; clapping &#93; from a distance , so i look over .
and he grabs my arm and the translator &apos;s , and ducks us under a bush and says , &quot; watch this . &quot;
&quot; shush , &quot; he says again for the 500th time to me .
&quot; shush , watch this . &quot;
&#91; clapping &#93; and they &apos;re getting louder , louder , louder , like really loud , right over us .
and like airport traffic control , as they start to go past us they &apos;re called back -- and they &apos;re called back and back and back .
and then they circle around .
and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese .
&#91; clapping &#93; and the wild geese are calling down .
&#91; clapping &#93; and it &apos;s getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land .
and i &apos;m just saying , &quot; no way . &quot;
no way .
and i look at eduardo , who &apos;s near tears looking at this , and i say , &quot; you &apos;re telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit ? &quot;
and he says , &quot; no , no , no .
they &apos;ve come to stay . &quot;
they &apos;ve come to stay ?
it &apos;s like the dna of a goose is to fly south in the winter , right ?
i said that . i said &quot; isn &apos;t that what they &apos;re put on this earth for ?
to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm ? &quot;
he said , &quot; no , no , no .
their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life .
to happiness .
they find it here .
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
they stop . they mate with his domesticated geese , and his flock continues .
think about that for a minute .
imagine -- i don &apos;t know , imagine a hog farm in , like , north carolina , and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay .
so how did it taste ?
i finally got to taste it before i left .
he took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras , confit de foie gras .
it was incredible .
and the problem with saying that , of course , is that you know , at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .
and i &apos;d like to make a metaphor , but i don &apos;t have one really .
i was drinking this guy &apos;s kool-aid so much , he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like , this guy &apos;s a genius , you know ?
but it truly was the best foie gras of my life .
so much so that i don &apos;t think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment .
i &apos;d had something that was called foie gras .
but this was transformative . really transformative .
and i say to you , i might not stick to this , but i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with eduardo .
it was sweet , it was unctuous .
it had all the qualities of foie gras , but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty .
and you could taste herbs , you could taste spices .
and i kept -- i said , you know , i swear to god i tasted star anise .
i was sure of it .
and i &apos;m not like some super taster , you know ?
but i can taste things .
there &apos;s 100 percent star anise in there .
and he says , &quot; no . &quot;
but no .
he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras , he sticks them in this jar and he confits it .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what ?
we went back out for the final tour of the farm , and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .
he doesn &apos;t need salt and pepper .
and he doesn &apos;t need spices , because he &apos;s got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on .
i turned to him at the end of the meal , and it &apos;s a question i asked several times , and he hadn &apos;t , kind of , answered me directly , but i said , &quot; now look , you &apos;re in spain , some of the greatest chefs in the world are -- ferran adria , the preeminent chef of the world today , not that far from you .
how come you don &apos;t give him this ?
how come no one &apos;s really heard of you ? &quot;
and it may be because of the wine , or it may be because of my excitement , he answered me directly and he said , &quot; because chefs don &apos;t deserve my foie gras . &quot;
and he was right .
he was right .
chefs take foie gras and they make it their own .
they create a dish where all the vectors point at us .
with eduardo it &apos;s about the expression of nature .
and as he said , i think fittingly , it &apos;s a gift from god , with god saying , you &apos;ve done good work .
simple .
i flew home , i &apos;m on the flight with my little black book and i took , you know , pages and pages of notes about it .
i really was moved .
and in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes , is this note that says , when asked , what do you think of conventional foie gras ?
what do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats ?
and i wrote , insult to history .
i &apos;m on the plane and i &apos;m just tearing my hair out .
it &apos;s like , why didn &apos;t i follow up on that ?
what the hell does that mean ?
insult to history .
so i did some research when i got back , and here &apos;s what i found .
the history of foie gras .
jews invented foie gras .
true story .
true story .
by accident .
they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz .
gotten sick of the chicken fat .
they were looking for an alternative .
and they saw in the fall that there was this natural , beautiful , sweet , delicious fat from geese .
and they slaughtered them , used the fat throughout the winter for cooking .
the pharaoh got wind of this -- this is true , right off the internet .
the pharaoh got -- i swear to god .
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
he tasted it and fell in love with it .
he started demanding it .
and he didn &apos;t want it just in the fall , he wanted it all year round .
and the jews , fearing for their life , had to come up with an ingenious idea , or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh &apos;s wishes , of course .
and they invented , what ? gavage .
they invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives , and they provided the pharaoh with gavage liver , and the good stuff they kept for themselves .
supposedly , anyway . i believe that one .
that &apos;s the history of foie gras .
and if you think about it , it &apos;s the history of industrial agriculture .
it &apos;s the history of what we eat today .
most of what we eat today .
mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .
all of it , our food system .
that &apos;s also an insult to history .
it &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
whether we &apos;re talking about beef cattle or we &apos;re talking about chickens , or we &apos;re talking about broccoli or brussels sprouts , or in the case of this morning &apos;s new york times , catfish -- which wholesale are going out of business .
whatever it is , it &apos;s a mindset that is reminiscent of general motors .
it &apos;s rooted in extraction .
take more , sell more , waste more .
and for the future it won &apos;t serve us .
jonas salk has a great quote .
he said , &quot; if all the insects disappeared , life on earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years .
if human beings disappeared , life on earth as we know it would flourish . &quot;
and he &apos;s right .
we need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture .
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .
and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food .
we can start by looking to farmers like eduardo .
farmers that rely on nature for solutions , for answers , rather than imposing solutions on nature .
listening as janine benyus , one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says , &quot; listening to nature &apos;s operating instructions . &quot;
that &apos;s what eduardo does , and does so brilliantly .
and what he showed me and what he can show all of us , i think , is that the great thing for chefs , the great blessing for chefs , and for people that care about food and cooking , is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food .
whether we &apos;re talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras .
and it &apos;s also almost always , and i haven &apos;t found an example otherwise , but almost always , the most delicious choice .
that &apos;s serendipitous .
thank you .
at the taste3 conference , chef dan barber tells the story of a small farm in spain that has found a humane way to produce foie gras . raising his geese in a natural environment , farmer eduardo sousa embodies the kind of food production barber believes in .
america &apos;s public energy conversation boils down to this question : would you rather die of a ) oil wars , or b ) climate change , or c ) nuclear holocaust , or d ) all of the above ?
oh , i missed one : or e ) none of the above ?
that &apos;s the one we &apos;re not normally offered .
what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing ?
could we have fuel without fear ?
could we reinvent fire ?
you see , fire made us human ; fossil fuels made us modern .
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , secure , healthy and durable .
let &apos;s see how .
four-fifths of the world &apos;s energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo .
they &apos;ve created our wealth .
they &apos;ve enriched the lives of billions .
but they also have rising costs to our security , economy , health and environment that are starting to erode , if not outweigh their benefits .
so we need a new fire .
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air .
but they &apos;re really quite distinct .
less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil -- although almost half is made from coal .
their uses are quite concentrated .
three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation .
three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings .
and the rest of both runs factories .
so very efficient vehicles , buildings and factories save oil and coal , and also natural gas that can displace both of them .
but today &apos;s energy system is not just inefficient , it is also disconnected , aging , dirty and insecure .
so it needs refurbishment .
by 2050 though , it could become efficient , connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos , factories and buildings all relying on a modern , secure and resilient electricity system .
we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply .
this could cost , by 2050 , five trillion dollars less in net present value , that is expressed as a lump sum today , than business as usual -- assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero -- a conservatively low estimate .
yet this cheaper energy system could support 158 percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal , or for that matter nuclear energy .
moreover , this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress and no new federal taxes , mandate subsidies or laws and running washington gridlock .
let me say that again .
i &apos;m going to tell you how to get the united states completely off oil and coal , five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of congress led by business for profit .
in other words , we &apos;re going to use our most effective institutions -- private enterprise co-evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions .
general eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies .
so in reinventing fire , we integrated all four sectors that use energy -- transportation , buildings , industry and electricity -- and we integrated four kinds of innovation , not just technology and policy , but also design and business strategy .
those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts , especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities .
oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day , plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs , raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp .
our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles .
so let &apos;s start by making autos oil free .
two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight .
and every unit of energy you save at the wheels , by taking out weight or drag , saves seven units in the tank , because you don &apos;t have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels .
unfortunately , over the past quarter century , epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have .
but today , ultralight , ultrastrong materials , like carbon fiber composites , can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build .
lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them , so their engines get smaller .
indeed , that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper .
so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today , while the driving cost , even from the start , is very much lower .
so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other -- namely ultralight materials , making them into structures and electric propulsion .
the sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates , that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones .
and just in the first two years the biggest of europe &apos;s five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency .
the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers .
of course , computers and electronics are now america &apos;s biggest industry , while typewriter makers have vanished .
so vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years , but then also make electrification affordable , and that displaces the rest of the oil .
america could lead this next automotive revolution .
currently the leader is germany .
last year , volkswagen announced that by next year they &apos;ll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon .
and they said , &quot; we do not intend to be a typewriter maker . &quot;
audi claimed it &apos;s going to beat them both by a year .
seven years ago , an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part , which doubles as a carbon cap .
in one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is .
don &apos;t worry about dropping it , it &apos;s tougher than titanium .
tom friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it .
but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance .
they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos .
they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel .
if we made all of our autos this way , it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half saudi arabias , or half an opec , by drilling in the detroit formation , a very prospective play .
and all those mega-barrels under detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel .
they are all-american , carbon-free and inexhaustible .
the same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles .
in the five years ending with 2010 , walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design .
but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds .
and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes , now on the drawing board , can save close to a trillion dollars .
also today &apos;s military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military r &amp; amp ; d has given us the internet , the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries .
as we design and build vehicles better , we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving .
instead of just seeing the travel grow , we can use innovative pricing , charging for road infrastructure by the mile , not by the gallon .
we can use some smart it to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing .
we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be , so they don &apos;t need to go somewhere else .
and we can use smart it to make traffic free-flowing .
so 40 years hence , when you add it all up , a far more mobile u.s. economy can use no oil .
saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred , adds up to a $ 4 trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero .
so to get mobility without oil , to phase out the oil , we can get efficient and then switch fuels .
those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells , electricity and advanced biofuels .
the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
the trucks could even use natural gas .
but no vehicles will need oil .
and the most biofuel we might need , just three million barrels a day , can be made two-thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate .
our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call &quot; institutional acupuncture . &quot;
we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly , we stick little needles in it to get it flowing , working with partners like ford and walmart and the pentagon .
and the long transition is already well under way .
in fact , three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil , not in supply , but in demand .
and deutsche bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016 .
in other words , oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices .
rather , when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids , they &apos;re adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power .
so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately .
and they also converge the oil story with our second big story , saving electricity and then making it differently .
and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector , because we &apos;ve got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions , rules and cultures .
changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it .
most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we &apos;re installing them .
so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper .
but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy , america &apos;s electricity use could actually shrink , even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos .
over the next 40 years , buildings , which use three-quarters of the electricity , can triple or quadruple their energy productivity , saving 1.4 trillion dollars , net present value , with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in english , the savings are worth four times what they cost .
and industry can accelerate too , doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return .
the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings .
that is , it can give you expanding returns , not diminishing returns .
that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the empire state building -- remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light , but reflect heat .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third .
and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved 17 million dollars of capital cost , which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years .
integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry .
dow &apos;s billion-dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars .
but industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars of energy still to save .
for example , three-fifths of the world &apos;s electricity runs motors .
half of that runs pumps and fans .
and those can all be made more efficient , and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements , paying back in about a year .
but first we ought to be capturing bigger , cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks .
for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy , not by getting better pumps , but just by replacing long , thin , crooked pipes with fat , short , straight pipes .
this is not about new technology , it &apos;s just rearranging our metal furniture .
of course , it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs .
so what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors ?
well , from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses , only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow .
but now let &apos;s turn those compounding losses around backwards , and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost , pollution and what hunter lovins calls &quot; global weirding &quot; back at the power plant .
and of course , as you go back upstream , the components get smaller and therefore cheaper .
typically our retrofit designs save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy and pay back in a few years , while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent with generally lower capital cost .
now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity , chiefly renewables .
china leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost .
in fact , these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart .
and germany now has more solar workers than america has steel workers .
already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill .
such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company .
and this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams .
renewables are no longer a fringe activity .
for each of the past four years half of the world &apos;s new generating capacity has been renewable , mainly lately in developing countries .
in 2010 , renewables other than big hydro , particularly wind and solar cells , got 151 billion dollars of private investment , and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year .
that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year -- a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year .
in contrast , the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk .
in fact in this country , no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital , despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies .
so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants ?
well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and , combined with renewables , can displace them more than 23 times at less than their replacement cost .
but we only need to replace them once .
we &apos;re often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on , because they &apos;re 24 / 7 , whereas wind and solar power are variable , and hence supposedly unreliable .
actually no generator is 24 / 7 . they all break .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds , often for weeks or months , often without warning .
that is exactly why we &apos;ve designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants .
and in exactly the same way , the grid can handle wind and solar power &apos;s forecastable variations .
and that &apos;s true both for continental areas like the u.s. or europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid .
that is how , for example , four german states in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent wind powered .
portugal was 45 percent renewable powered , denmark 36 .
and it &apos;s how all of europe can shift to renewable electricity .
in america , our aging , dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 .
and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same , about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we &apos;ve got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal , or renewables that are more or less centralized .
but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks , around national security , fuel , water , finance , technology , climate and health .
for example , our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack .
but that blackout risk disappears , and all of the other risks are best managed , with distributed renewables organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect , but can stand alone at need .
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
that approach is exactly what the pentagon is adopting for its own power supply .
they think they need that ; how about the rest of us that they &apos;re defending ?
we want our stuff to work too .
at about the same cost as business as usual , this would maximize national security , customer choice , entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation .
together , efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector .
traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables .
and those utilities were rewarded , as they still are in 34 states , for selling you more electricity .
however , especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills , the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency , demand response , cogeneration , renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage .
so our energy future is not fate , but choice , and that choice is very flexible .
in 1976 , for example , government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of gdp could never go down .
and i heretically suggested it could go down several-fold .
well that &apos;s what &apos;s actually happened so far .
but with today &apos;s much better technologies , more mature delivery channels and integrative design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
so to solve the energy problem , we just needed to enlarge it .
and the results may at first seem incredible , but as marshall mcluhan said , &quot; only puny secrets need protection .
big discoveries are protected by public incredulity . &quot;
now combine the electricity and oil revolutions , both driven by modern efficiency , and you get the really big story : reinventing fire , where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the united states completely off oil and coal by 2050 , saving 5 trillion dollars , growing the economy 2.6-fold , strengthening out national security , oh , and by the way , by getting rid of the oil and coal , reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent .
now if you like any of those outcomes , you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important .
so focusing on outcomes , not motives , can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america &apos;s energy challenge .
this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges -- climate change , nuclear proliferation , energy insecurity , energy poverty -- all of which make us less safe .
now our team at rmi helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives , with some more hatching .
of course there &apos;s still a lot of old thinking out there too .
former oil man maurice strong said , &quot; not all the fossils are in the fuel . &quot;
but as edgar woolard , who used to chair dupont , reminds us , &quot; companies hampered by old thinking won &apos;t be a problem because , &quot; he said , &quot; they simply won &apos;t be around long-term . &quot;
i &apos;ve described not just a once-in-a-civilization business opportunity , but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species .
we humans are inventing a new fire , not dug from below , but flowing from above ; not scarce , but bountiful ; not local , but everywhere ; not transient , but permanent ; not costly , but free .
and but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure , this new fire is flameless .
efficiently used , it really can do our work without working our undoing .
each of you owns a piece of that $ 5 trillion prize .
and our new book &quot; reinventing fire &quot; describes how you can capture it .
so with the conversation just begun at reinventingfire.com , let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other , with everyone around you , to help make the world richer , fairer , cooler and safer by together reinventing fire .
thank you .
amory lovins : a 40-year plan for energy
in this intimate talk filmed at ted &apos;s offices , energy innovator amory lovins shows how to get the us off oil and coal by 2050 , $ 5 trillion cheaper , with no act of congress , led by business for profit . the key is integrating all four energy-using sectors — and four kinds of innovation .
my brothers and i dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
he was livid , and i still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
later , i understood why my father got so upset .
those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
my father was responsible for building roads in bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
his was a lonely struggle , because bihar was also india &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
and i experienced this most viscerally when i traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
and as i went village to village , i remember one day , when i was famished and exhausted , and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
this profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
i resolved to give back .
later , i joined the world bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
my initial work focused on uganda , where i focused on negotiating reforms with the finance ministry of uganda so they could access our loans .
but after we disbursed the loans , i remember a trip in uganda where i found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
it was bihar all over again .
bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work i did in uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of world war ii , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in new hampshire , usa , to establish the bretton woods institutions , including the world bank .
and that traditional approach to development had three key elements . first , transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
and third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar .
you know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the u.s. , europe or the world bank .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the south .
they want to know how china lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how mexico &apos;s oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
this is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling north to south , but south to south , and even south to north , with mexico &apos;s oportunidades today inspiring new york city .
and just as these north-to-south transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
this is the second shift : open aid .
recently , the world bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
take geomapping . in this map from kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
so this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
in this manner , the world bank has now geomapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
this is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
and this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
from the arab spring to the anna hazare movement in india , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
so for instance , several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public .
but , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
this is a public budget .
and as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
to tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
in this map from moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
so in the philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , checkmyschool.org , or using sms , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar .
and you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading south to south , from the philippines to indonesia , kenya , moldova and beyond .
in dar es salaam , tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
this is what the map of tandale looked like in august , 2011 . but within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
and what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
today , even bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
but , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
these are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
so for instance , today , in ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
these examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems i witnessed in uganda or that my father confronted in bihar .
two years ago , on april 8th , 2010 , i called my father .
it was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . he won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
he fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
these became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
today , i &apos;m inspired by these changes , and i &apos;m excited that at the world bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in uganda 20 years ago .
we need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
we need to accelerate these shifts .
if we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in bihar , in uganda , and beyond .
we will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
thank you .
sanjay pradhan : how open data is changing international aid
you will understand nothing with my type of english .
it &apos;s good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people .
i must tell you i am like that , not very comfortable , because usually , in life , i think my job is absolutely useless .
i mean , i feel useless .
now after carolyn , and all the other guys , i feel like shit .
and definitively , i don &apos;t know why i am here , but -- you know the nightmare you can have , like you are an impostor , you arrive at the opera , and they push you , &quot; you must sing ! &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
so , so , because i have nothing to show , nothing to say , we shall try to speak about something else .
we can start , if you want , by understanding -- it &apos;s just to start , it &apos;s not interesting , but -- how i work .
when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known , i mean , yes , lemon squeezer , toilet brush , toothpick , beautiful toilet seats , and why not -- a toothbrush ?
i don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
i don &apos;t try to say , &quot; oh , that will be a beautiful object , &quot; or something like that .
that doesn &apos;t interest me .
because there is different types of design .
the one , we can call it the cynical design , that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the &apos; 50s , who said , what is ugly is a bad sale , la laideur se vend mal , which is terrible .
it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing , for producer to make product more sexy , like that , they sell more : it &apos;s shit , it &apos;s obsolete , it &apos;s ridiculous .
i call that the cynical design .
after , there is the narcissistic design : it &apos;s a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers .
after , there is people like me , who try to deserve to exist , and who are so ashamed to make this useless job , who try to do it in another way , and they try , i try , to not make the object for the object but for the result , for the profit for the human being , the person who will use it .
if we take the toothbrush -- i don &apos;t think about the toothbrush .
i think , &quot; what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth ? &quot;
and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth , i must imagine : who owns this mouth ?
what civilization creates this society ?
what animal species creates this civilization ?
when i arrive -- and i take one minute , i am not so intelligent -- when i arrive at the level of animal species , that becomes real interesting .
me , i have strictly no power to change anything .
but when i come back , i can understand why i shall not do it , because today to not do it , it &apos;s more positive than do it , or how i shall do it .
but to come back , where i am at the animal species , there is things to see .
there is things to see , there is the big challenge .
the big challenge in front of us .
because there is not a human production which exists outside of what i call &quot; the big image . &quot;
the big image is our story , our poetry , our romanticism .
our poetry is our mutation , our life .
we must remember , and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old , that life appears four billion years ago , around -- four billion point two ?
voice offstage : four point five .
yes , point five , ok , ok , ok ! i &apos;m a designer , that &apos;s all , of christmas gifts .
and before , there was this soup , called &quot; soupe primordiale , &quot; this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop -- sort of dirty mud , no life , nothing .
so then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive -- pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies .
some million years after -- pshoo-shoo , bloop-bloop -- ah , wake up !
we was so , so stupid . the most stupid bacteria .
even , i think , we copy our way to reproduce , you know what i mean , and something of -- oh no , forget it .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a frog ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-monkey , and the fun is , the super-monkey we are today , is at half of the story .
can you imagine ? from that stupid bacteria to us , with a microphone , with a computer , with an ipod : four billion years .
and we know , and especially carolyn knows , that when the sun will implode , the earth will burn , explode , i don &apos;t know what , and this is scheduled for four , four billion years ?
fantastic ! it &apos;s a beauty !
can you imagine ? it &apos;s very symbolic .
because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today .
and today , we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years .
and this territory is fantastic .
that is our poetry . that is our beautiful story .
it &apos;s our romanticism . mu-ta-tion . we are mutants .
and if we don &apos;t deeply understand , if we don &apos;t integrate that we are mutants , we completely miss the story .
because every generation thinks we are the final one .
we have a way to look at earth like that , you know , &quot; i am the man . the final man .
you know , we mutate during four billion years before , but now , because it &apos;s me , we stop . fin .
for the end , for the eternity , it is one with a red jacket . &quot;
something like that . i am not sure of that .
because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that .
there is so many things to do ; it &apos;s so fresh .
and here is something : nobody is obliged to be a genius , but everybody is obliged to participate .
we can say that .
the first , if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do , is the duty of vision .
i can explain you . i shall try .
if you walk like that , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
and you will fall , and you will die . dangerous .
ok , i can see , if i found something , up , up , and they continue , up up up .
you , you survive . it &apos;s ok .
if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go , &quot; i see you , oh my god you are here , how are you , i can help you , i can design for you a new toothbrush , new toilet brush , &quot; something like that .
i live in society ; i live in community .
it &apos;s ok . you start to be in the territory of intelligence , we can say .
from this level , the more you can raise this angle of view , the more you will be important for the society .
the more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
the more you will rise , to see far and high , like that , the more you will be important for the story of our mutation .
that means intelligent people are in this angle . that is intelligence .
from this to here , that , it &apos;s genius .
ptolemy , eratosthenes , einstein , things like that .
nobody &apos;s obliged to be a genius .
it &apos;s better , but nobody .
take care , in this training , to be a good mutant .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
because at the vertical of us , if you look like that , &quot; ah ! my god , there is god . ah ! god ! &quot;
god is a trap . god is the answer when we don &apos;t know the answer .
that means , when your brain is not enough big , when you don &apos;t understand , you go , &quot; ah , it &apos;s god , it &apos;s god . &quot; that &apos;s ridiculous .
that &apos;s why -- jump , like that ? no , don &apos;t jump .
come back . because , after , there is another trap .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexible , inside yourself .
it &apos;s called schizophrenia , and you are dead also .
that &apos;s why every morning , now , because you are a good mutant , out , more of the horizontal . you are an intelligence .
it &apos;s very , very , very important .
what , what else we can say about that ? why do that ?
it &apos;s because we -- if we look from far , we see our line of evolution .
this line of evolution is clearly positive .
from far , this line looks very smooth , like that .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
it &apos;s made of light and shadow .
we can say light is civilization , shadow is barbaria .
and it &apos;s very important to know where we are .
because some cycle , there is a spot in the cycle , and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle .
that means , we can imagine -- i don &apos;t say it was fantastic , but in the &apos; 80s , there was not too much war , like that , it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized .
in this case , people like me are acceptable .
we can say , &quot; it &apos;s luxurious time . &quot;
we have time to think , we have time to i don &apos;t know what , speak about art and things like that .
it &apos;s ok . we are in the light .
but sometimes , like today , we fall , we fall so fast , so fast to shadow , we fall so fast to barbaria .
with many , many , many , many face of barbaria .
because it &apos;s not , the barbaria we have today , it &apos;s perhaps not the barbaria we think .
there is different type of barbaria .
that &apos;s why we must adapt .
that means , when barbaria is back , forget the beautiful chairs , forget the beautiful hotel , forget design , even -- i &apos;m sorry to say -- forget art .
forget all that . there is priority ; there is urgency .
you must go back to fight , to battle .
that &apos;s why today i &apos;m so ashamed to make this job .
that &apos;s why i am here , to try to do it the best possible .
but i know that even i do it the best possible -- that &apos;s why i &apos;m the best -- it &apos;s nothing .
because it &apos;s not the right time .
that &apos;s why i say that . i say that , because , i repeat , nothing exist if it &apos;s not in the good reason , the reason of our beautiful dream , of this civilization .
and because we must all work to finish this story .
because the scenario of this civilization -- about love , progress , and things like that -- it &apos;s ok , but there is so many different , other scenarios of other civilizations .
this scenario , of this civilization , was about becoming powerful , intelligent , like this idea we have invented , this concept of god .
we are god now . we are . it &apos;s almost done .
we have just to finish the story .
that is very , very important .
and when you don &apos;t understand really what &apos;s happened , you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that .
you go to the future back , back , back , back , like that .
and you can fall , and it &apos;s very dangerous .
no , you must really understand that .
because we have almost finished , i &apos;ll repeat this story .
and the beauty of this , in perhaps 50 years , 60 years , we can finish completely this civilization , and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story , a new poetry , a new romanticism .
with billions of people who have been born , worked , lived and died before us , these people who have worked so much , we have now bring beautiful things , beautiful gifts , we know so many things .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
now you have a duty : invent a new story . invent a new poetry .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
we give you the best tools , the best tools , and now , do it .
that &apos;s why i continue to work , even if it &apos;s for toilet brush .
philippe starck : design and destiny
designer philippe starck -- with no pretty slides to show -- spends 18 minutes reaching for the very roots of the question &quot; why design ? &quot; listen carefully for one perfect mantra for all of us , genius or not .
what i want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what &apos;s scheduled .
foreign policy , you can figure that out by watching , i don &apos;t know , rachel maddow or somebody , but — — i want to talk about young people and structure , young people and structure .
this was last wednesday afternoon at a school in brooklyn , new york , at cristo rey high school , run by the jesuits .
they were around me in three directions .
you &apos;ll noticed that almost all of them are minority .
it &apos;s an old new york school building , nothing fancy .
they still have old blackboards and whatnot .
and there are about 300 kids in this school , and the school &apos;s been going now for four years , and they &apos;re about to graduate their first class .
