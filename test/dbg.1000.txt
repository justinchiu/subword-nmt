and it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task , but what i &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that i think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
and those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and i &apos;m going to start with this one : if momma ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
we know that , right ? we &apos;ve experienced that .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
that &apos;s the theme of my talk .
and we &apos;re making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
this is a shot of cannery row in 1932 .
cannery row , at the time , had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast .
we piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
rolf bolin , who was a professor at the hopkin &apos;s marine station where i work , wrote in the 1940s that &quot; the fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black . &quot;
people working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
they say , &quot; you know what you smell ?
that pollution was money to that community , and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
we made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages , and i want to call that &quot; pinch a minnow , hurt a whale . &quot;
the pyramid of ocean life ...
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- i have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
we see the base of the food chain , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
and that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . heal the ocean . &quot;
now why does that matter for human health ?
because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very frightening things happen .
pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like pcbs that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
and they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up ; they &apos;re passed up that way , on to predators and on to the top predators , and in so doing , they accumulate .
now , to bring that home , i thought i &apos;d invent a little game .
we don &apos;t really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
it &apos;s the styrofoam and chocolate game .
imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two styrofoam peanuts .
can &apos;t do much with them : put them in your pocket .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too .
what &apos;ll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the drunkest , stingiest people .
there &apos;s no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible styrofoam peanuts .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens with pdbs in this food pyramid : they accumulate into the top of it .
now suppose , instead of styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around , and instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they &apos;re absorbed by us .
and that &apos;s the difference between a pcb and , say , something natural like an omega-3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
pcbs accumulate in dolphins in sarasota bay , in texas , in north carolina .
they get into the food chain .
the dolphins eat the fish that have pcbs from the plankton , and those pcbs , being fat-soluble , accumulate in these dolphins .
now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there &apos;s only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .
and what &apos;s that ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
adult males : a huge load .
juveniles : a huge load .
females after their first calf is already weaned : a lower load .
those females , they &apos;re not trying to .
those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their offspring , and their offspring don &apos;t survive .
the death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant , and most of them die .
now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf .
there &apos;s another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo -- or is it ?
in fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
that &apos;s another story .
even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
and those dolphin parts had a huge load of pcbs , dioxins and heavy metals .
and that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
that &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
we had these data a few years ago .
i remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
and for the very first time in my scientific career , i broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them .
we sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation , not for us , but for the people of japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
that led to a whole series of other campaigns in japan , and i &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in japan that &apos;s labeled incorrectly , even though they &apos;re still selling whale meat , which i believe they shouldn &apos;t .
but at least it &apos;s labeled correctly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
it isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the canadian arctic and in the united states and in the european arctic , a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of pcbs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
these women have toxic breast milk .
they cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
that means their immune systems are compromised .
it means that their children &apos;s development can be compromised .
and the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women , not by changing the pyramid , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
we &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
there &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyramid .
the pyramid , if we jam things in the bottom , can get backed up like a sewer line that &apos;s clogged .
and if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
we end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red tides , for example , which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage .
we can also see blooms of bacteria , blooms of viruses in the ocean .
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
how many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
why does that happen ?
it happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
not very often . we wouldn &apos;t tolerate that .
we wouldn &apos;t tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage , but beaches are closed a lot in our country .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
it &apos;s not just a question of cleanliness ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
these vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
they can go into your skin and create skin infections .
this is a graph from noaa &apos;s ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years .
surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
and if you can see on some surfing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some surf rider sites , you see a little flashing poo alert .
that means that the beach might have great waves , but it &apos;s a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of surfing , this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve .
some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now , and that makes them even more difficult .
these same infections create harmful algal blooms .
those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms : shellfish poisoning , fish ciguatera , diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning , paralytic shellfish poisoning .
these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms .
rita calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this copepod .
copepods are small crustaceans .
they &apos;re a tiny fraction of an inch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these vectors of cholera around the world .
so what do you do ?
we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged .
well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
you could call joe the plumber , for example .
and he could come in and fix the flow .
but in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fixed , where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around .
monterey is one of those .
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
in 1932 , that &apos;s the picture .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
the canneries are gone . the pollution has abated .
but there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems .
they need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top .
and that pyramid in monterey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it &apos;s ever functioned for the last 150 years .
it didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
on the left there , julia platt , the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove .
at 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
in 1931 , she produced california &apos;s first community-based marine protected area , right next to the biggest polluting cannery , because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed , and she wanted to provide that seed .
other people , like david packard and julie packard , who were instrumental in producing the monterey bay aquarium to lock into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
well , i want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid , and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life .
it &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species , but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
and it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves .
there &apos;s a tight and surprising link between the ocean &apos;s health and ours , says marine biologist stephen palumbi . he shows how toxins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies , with a shocking story of toxic contamination from a japanese fish market . his work points a way forward for saving the oceans &apos; health -- and humanity &apos;s .
adrian kohler : well , we &apos;re here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse .
basil jones : but actually we &apos;re going to start this evolution with a hyena .
okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; faustus in africa , &quot; a handspring production from 1995 , where it had to play draughts with helen of troy .
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director , william kentridge .
so it needed a very articulate front paw .
but , like all puppets , it has other attributes .
ak : haa haa haaa .
bj : breath is really important for us .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
puppets always have to try to be alive .
it &apos;s their kind of ur-story onstage , that desperation to live .
ak : yeah , it &apos;s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
an actor struggles to die onstage , but a puppet has to struggle to live .
and in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
bj : so every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the struggle .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs .
ak : well actually i prefer to say that it &apos;s an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life .
ak : it has ears that move passively when the head goes .
bj : and it has these bulkheads made out of plywood , covered with fabric -- curiously similar , in fact , to the plywood canoes that adrian &apos;s father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop .
and when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971 , i hated puppets .
and , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa , where there &apos;s a fabulous tradition of puppetry , to learn a renewed , or a new , respect for this art form .
ak : so in 1981 , i persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company .
and 20 years later , miraculously , we collaborated with a company from mali , the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako , where we made a piece about a tall giraffe .
it was just called &quot; tall horse , &quot; which was a life-sized giraffe .
the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
ak : the person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail , a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism , just a bit bigger .
and he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
bj : so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : it &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
the horse is sold to the first world war , and he joins up to find his horse .
bj : so tom gave us a call and said , &quot; do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national theatre ? &quot;
ak : it seemed a lovely idea .
bj : but it had to ride . it had to have a rider .
a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london .
so we began with a test .
bj : this is adrian and thys stander , who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse , and our next-door neighbor katherine , riding on a ladder .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
so we made a model .
this is a cardboard model , a little bit smaller than the hyena .
you &apos;ll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there .
bj : and the two manipulators are inside .
ak : we started work on the prototype after the model was approved , and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated .
and we had a crate built for it .
it had to be shipped to london .
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town , and it got to midnight and we hadn &apos;t done that yet .
bj : so we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances .
and we sent it off to the national theatre , hoping that they believed that we created something that worked .
ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
bj : about 40 people .
ak : we were terrified .
we opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden .
here i have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype .
this is in the national theatre studio , the place where they cook new ideas .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
the choreographer , toby sedgwick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse .
and nick starr , the director of the national theatre , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself .
and so the show was given the green light .
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .
here is the plan .
and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
the horses are completely handmade .
but because they have to be light and flexible , and each one of them is different , they can &apos;t be mass-produced , unfortunately .
so here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in london .
joey boy , you there ?
joey .
joey .
joey , come here .
no , no , i haven &apos;t got it .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
move around . come on .
i &apos;d just like to describe -- i won &apos;t talk too loud . he might get irritated .
here , craig is working the head .
he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
but he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
when they point right back , the horse is fearful or angry , depending upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
or , when he &apos;s more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
horses &apos; hearing is very important .
it &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
over here , tommy &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
he &apos;s working the leg .
you see the string tendon from the hyena , the hyena &apos;s front leg , automatically pulls the hoop up .
horses are so unpredictable .
the way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convincing horse action .
and together , there &apos;s quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that &apos;s how a horse would breathe , with an expanded chest .
so he made a channel in here , and the chest moves up and down in that channel .
so it &apos;s anti-naturalistic really , the up and down movement , but it feels like breath .
and it &apos;s very , very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .
if i were to touch the horse here on his skin , the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
the skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh , which , if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear , she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
or if you light it from above , it becomes more solid .
again , that was a practical consideration .
the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
they have to be able to act and it &apos;s very much an in-the-moment activity that they &apos;re engaged in .
it &apos;s three heads making one character .
but now we would like you to put joey through some paces .
and plant .
thank you .
and now just -- all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who &apos;s going to ride the horse for us .
so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly .
bj : not being able to talk to one another while they &apos;re onstage because they &apos;re mic &apos;d .
the sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer , carries on with a second person and ends with a third .
ak : mikey brett from leicestershire .
thank you . thank you .
handspring puppet co . : the genius puppetry behind war horse
&quot; puppets always have to try to be alive , &quot; says adrian kohler of the handspring puppet company , a gloriously ambitious troupe of human and wooden actors . beginning with the tale of a hyena &apos;s subtle paw , puppeteers kohler and basil jones build to the story of their latest astonishment : the wonderfully life-like joey , the war horse , who trots convincingly onto the stage .
let &apos;s start with day and night .
life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
these are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
i &apos;ll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a sloped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it &apos;ll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
it &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
people actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole .
so , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
it &apos;s a huge driver for culture and i think that it &apos;s the most underrated force on our behavior .
we evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
but of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada , where i live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
so the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
and in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
so , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sunrise .
and in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
and during this time , there &apos;s a surge of prolactin , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they &apos;re experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .
so , cut to the modern day .
we &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
thank you .
jessa gamble : our natural sleep cycle
in today &apos;s world , balancing school , work , kids and more , most of us can only hope for the recommended eight hours of sleep . examining the science behind our body &apos;s internal clock , jessa gamble reveals the surprising and substantial program of rest we should be observing .
i want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
and in doing that , i want to offer you a vision , an imagined future , if you will , of how , as the poet seamus heaney has put it , &quot; once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history rhyme . &quot;
i want to start with these word pairs here .
we all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk-averse .
and in fact they weren &apos;t . they were reinventing charity in those times , what rockefeller called &quot; the business of benevolence . &quot;
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way .
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .
and it &apos;s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pressures .
i &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
this report is our main public report .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
what i want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you .
and as i do that , i &apos;m not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the gates or the soros or the google .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us : the democratization of philanthropy .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
the first is mass collaboration , represented here by wikipedia .
now , this may surprise you .
but remember , philanthropy is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
clay shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
he said , &quot; we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
now we have wikipedia .
suddenly big things can be done for love . &quot;
watch , this spring , for paul hawken &apos;s new book -- author and entrepreneur many of you may know about .
the book is called &quot; blessed unrest . &quot;
and when it comes out , a series of wiki sites under the label wiser , are going to launch at the same time .
wiser stands for world index for social and environmental responsibility .
wiser sets out to document , link and empower what paul calls the largest movement , and fastest-growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective immune response to today &apos;s threats .
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fastest , the most connected form of philanthropy in human history .
this is , of course , to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce .
think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy .
and this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy .
take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at donorschoose .
omidyar network has made a big investment in donorschoose .
it &apos;s one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
take a look at changing the present , started by a tedster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
giveindia is for a whole country .
and it goes on and on .
the third category is represented by warren buffet , which i call aggregated giving .
it &apos;s not just that warren buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer .
it &apos;s that he challenged another assumption , that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation .
there are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
one of the best known is acumen fund , led by jacqueline novogratz , a tedster who got a big boost here at ted .
but there are many others : new profit in cambridge , new school &apos;s venture fund in silicon valley , venture philanthropy partners in washington , global fund for women in san francisco .
take a look at these .
these funds are to philanthropy what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are to investing , but with a twist -- because often a community forms around these funds , as it has at acumen and other places .
now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online marketplaces , aggregated giving .
and understand how they help us re-perceive what organized philanthropy is .
it &apos;s not about foundations necessarily ; it &apos;s about the rest of us .
and imagine the mash-up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up , say , 100 million dollars for an inspiring goal -- there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the us last year , not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it &apos;s matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe , thereby engaging lots of people , and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that &apos;s stated .
they &apos;re betting a visible competition , a prize , can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and thereby speed the solution .
this tackles yet another assumption , that the giver and the organization is at the center , as opposed to putting the problem at the center .
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
that leaves the final category , social investing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , represented here by xigi.net.
and this , of course , tackles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
xigi is a new community site that &apos;s built by the community , linking and mapping this new social capital market .
it lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise .
so we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be astonishing .
now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .
philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes .
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don &apos;t yet fulfill this aspiration , i think this is the new zeitgeist : open , big , fast , connected , and , let us also hope , long .
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .
if we don &apos;t develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a fad .
but i &apos;m really hopeful .
and i &apos;m hopeful because it &apos;s not only philanthropy that &apos;s reorganizing itself , it &apos;s also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
and everywhere i go , including here at ted , i feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing .
what we &apos;re seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that &apos;s happening .
words like &quot; philanthrocapitalism , &quot; and &quot; natural capitalism , &quot; and &quot; philanthroentrepreneur , &quot; and &quot; venture philanthropy . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a language for it yet .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and i think it &apos;s gong to quite significant .
and that &apos;s where my imagined future comes in , which i am going to call the social singularity .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge &apos;s notion of a technological singularity , where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create , really , a shockingly new reality .
that &apos;s because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them .
and as we &apos;ve heard here , it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before .
the question is , is there a positive social singularity ?
is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
our future doesn &apos;t have to be imagined .
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme .
but we have a problem .
our experience to date , both individually and collectively , hasn &apos;t prepared us for what we &apos;re going to need to do , or who we &apos;re going to need to be .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
that &apos;s why i have one last thing i want to show you .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
this is a newspaper publisher and a banker .
and they were great community leaders .
and , yes , they were great philanthropists .
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
and so , in their honor , i want to offer you this blank slide .
and i want you to imagine that this a photograph of you .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
whatever that means to you .
and i want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grandchild , or great-grandchild , or niece or nephew or god-child , is looking at this photograph of you .
katherine fulton : you are the future of philanthropy
in this uplifting talk , katherine fulton sketches the new future of philanthropy -- one where collaboration and innovation allow regular people to do big things , even when money is scarce . giving five practical examples of crowd-driven philanthropy , she calls for a new generation of citizen leaders .
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of &quot; democratization of intimacy . &quot;
and what do i mean by that ?
i mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication channels , they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them .
how are they doing this ? they &apos;re doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by iming from their office to their friends , by texting under the desk .
the pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months .
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
and somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
one young woman brought her grandfather .
for 20 years , i &apos;ve been looking at how people use channels such as email , the mobile phone , texting , etc .
what we &apos;re actually going to see is that , fundamentally , people are communicating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most intimate sphere .
now , lets take some data . facebook .
recently some sociologists from facebook -- facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels .
and an average user , said cameron marlow , from facebook , has about 120 friends .
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
and when you go to skype , it &apos;s down to two people .
a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
i mean , i &apos;ve been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people .
and some sociologists actually feel that it &apos;s a closure , it &apos;s a cocooning , that we &apos;re disengaging from the public .
and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples .
and so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
and around eight o &apos;clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven , cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife .
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
and i &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
a young factory worker who works night shifts , who manages to sneak away from the factory floor , where there is cctv by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o &apos;clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;clock , suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home .
then there is another couple , there is a brazilian couple .
they &apos;ve lived in italy for a number of years .
they skype with their families a few times a week .
but once a fortnight , they actually put the computer on their dining table , pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo . and they have a big event of it .
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland .
they had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother .
but danny miller , who is a very good anthropologist who is working on filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the philippines , was telling me about how much parenting is going on through skype , and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through skype .
and then there is the third couple . they are two friends .
they chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
and this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends .
so , none of these cases are unique .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
but what is really exceptional is the setting .
but it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital .
three settings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clocked in , when you clocked in to an office , when you clocked in to a factory , there was no contact for the whole duration of the time , there was no contact with your private sphere .
if you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere .
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
maybe you had a direct line .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
and it had nothing to do with technical capability .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
that was where the focus had to be .
and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage .
if you think nursery , kindergarten , first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children , to make them used to staying long hours away from their family .
and then the school enacts perfectly well .
it mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices : rituals of entry , rituals of exit , the schedules , the uniforms in this country , things that identify you , team-building activities , team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
this only started about 150 years ago .
it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades .
they were living on top of the land they were laboring .
and if you think , it &apos;s permeated our whole culture , even our cities .
if you think of medieval cities , medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there .
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
and they are doing it massively .
the pew institute , which produces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the states , says that -- and i think that this number is conservative -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
i really think that the number is conservative .
in my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o &apos;clock in the morning , whatever the country .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
100 percent are using text .
the point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions .
i &apos;m always surprised the u.s. army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .
but there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access .
and every day , every single day , i read news that makes me cringe , like a $ 15 fine to kids in texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
immediate dismissal to bus drivers in new york , if seen with a mobile phone in a hand .
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy .
stefana broadbent : how the internet enables intimacy
we worry that im , texting , facebook are spoiling human intimacy , but stefana broadbent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships , bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules .
maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
maybe you thought , i &apos;ve had less to drink than everybody else , i should be the one to go home .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
does this sound familiar to you ?
now , in those situations , wouldn &apos;t it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push , and the car would get you home safely ?
now , that &apos;s been the promise of the self-driving car , the autonomous vehicle , and it &apos;s been the dream since at least 1939 , when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world &apos;s fair .
now , it &apos;s been one of those dreams that &apos;s always seemed about 20 years in the future .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of nevada granted google &apos;s self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada .
now , california &apos;s considering similar legislation , and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas .
now , in my lab at stanford , we &apos;ve been working on autonomous cars too , but with a slightly different spin on things . you see , we &apos;ve been developing robotic race cars , cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance .
now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
well , there &apos;s two really good reasons for this .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car , that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers .
now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
there &apos;s another reason as well .
just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road , all of the car &apos;s capabilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can .
now , you may push the car to the limits not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an icy patch of road , conditions have changed .
in those situations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided .
i must confess , there &apos;s kind of a third motivation as well .
you see , i have a passion for racing .
in the past , i &apos;ve been a race car owner , a crew chief and a driving coach , although maybe not at the level that you &apos;re currently expecting .
it &apos;s another one of those categories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
but this is p1 . it &apos;s an entirely student-built electric vehicle , which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
we &apos;ve also worked with volkswagen oracle , on shelley , an autonomous race car that has raced at 150 miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats , gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel .
i guess it goes without saying that we &apos;ve had a lot of fun doing this .
but in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars .
we have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers .
as we &apos;ve looked at the question of how well do these cars perform , we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts .
and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing .
now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathematical model of a car , and with some iteration , we can actually find the fastest way around that track .
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver , and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable .
yes , there are subtle differences here , but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line , without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade-off between going as fast as possible in this corner , and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here .
they &apos;re able to go out and consistently do this , pushing the car to the limits every single time .
it &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
you put them in a new car , and after a few laps , they &apos;ve found the fastest line in that car , and they &apos;re off to the races .
it really makes you think , we &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on inside their brain .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
now , this is dr. lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton .
john morton is a former can-am and imsa driver , who &apos;s also a class champion at le mans .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
she &apos;s putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john &apos;s brain as he races around the track .
however , neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
in contrast , theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual processing , things where the driver is thinking quite a bit .
now , we can measure this , and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves .
this gives us a measure of mental workload , how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track .
now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we headed down south to laguna seca .
laguna seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between salinas and monterey .
it has a curve there called the corkscrew .
now , the corkscrew is a chicane , followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories .
now , the strategy for driving this as explained to me was , you aim for the bush in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
all right , so thanks to the revs program at stanford , we were able to take john there and put him behind the wheel of a 1960 porsche abarth carrera .
life is way too short for boring cars .
so , here you see john on the track , he &apos;s going up the hill -- oh ! somebody liked that -- and you can see , actually , his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches .
now watch , he has to downshift .
look for the tree , and down .
not surprisingly , you can see this is a pretty challenging task .
you can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity .
but what &apos;s really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn &apos;t increase .
i &apos;m going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
turn three . and john &apos;s going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
he &apos;s going to have to correct for that with steering .
so watch as john does this here .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
not a challenging task .
in fact , entirely reflexive .
now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
it requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats .
and their actions are fantastic .
this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation .
now , this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles .
we &apos;ve started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive ?
can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers , introduce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans .
but it &apos;s made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur ?
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
so , as we move forward into this technological future , i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment .
what is the ideal balance of human and machine ?
and as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind .
thank you .
chris gerdes : the future race car -- 150mph , and no driver
autonomous cars are coming -- and they &apos;re going to drive better than you . chris gerdes reveals how he and his team are developing robotic race cars that can drive at 150 mph while avoiding every possible accident . and yet , in studying the brainwaves of professional racing drivers , gerdes says he has gained a new appreciation for the instincts of professional drivers . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the first one is happening right here in chicago .
brenda palms-farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
we know that two-thirds of them are going to go back .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
but brenda , not being phased by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution : create a business that produces skin care products from honey .
okay , it might be obvious to some of you ; it wasn &apos;t to me .
it &apos;s the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
she hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees , harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves , and that were later sold at whole foods .
she combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed , like anger-management and teamwork , and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more .
less than four percent actually go back to jail .
so these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process .
talk about a sweet beginning .
now , i &apos;m going to take you to los angeles , and lots of people know that l.a. has its issues .
they have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains .
currently , 20 percent of california &apos;s energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly southern california .
their spending loads , loads , to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well .
now andy lipkis is working to help l.a. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees , people and technology to create a more livable city .
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
because , come to think about it , do you really want air-conditioning , or is it a cooler room that you want ?
how you get it shouldn &apos;t make that much of a difference .
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves .
and by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure .
so ultimately , 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided , and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down , while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up , resulting in a net-savings to the system , but also healthier students and schools system employees as well .
now judy bonds is a coal miner &apos;s daughter .
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
and if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be judy .
but the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father &apos;s father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
now , two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years &apos; worth of coal .
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it &apos;s filled with the residue of explosives and coal .
when we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners , but everybody .
and judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain , and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet .
three years of dirty energy with not many jobs , or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills , and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region &apos;s wind .
she calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time , and it &apos;s a net-plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
it &apos;s a longer payback than mountaintop removal , but the wind energy actually pays back forever .
now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery .
the water is turned into goo .
most people are still unemployed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse , domestic abuse , teen pregnancy and poor heath , as well .
now judy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other .
not quite an obvious alliance .
i mean , they are not -- they ain &apos;t competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the endangered hillbillies . &quot;
so homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it &apos;s all about .
but just a few months ago , judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer .
yeah .
and it has since moved to her bones and her brain .
and i just find it so bizarre that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her legacy .
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
but rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something , she &apos;s leaving behind a business plan to make it happen .
that &apos;s what my homegirl is doing .
so i &apos;m so proud of that .
but these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
they &apos;re all problem solvers , and they &apos;re just some of the many examples that i really am privileged to see , meet and learn from in the examples of the work that i do now .
i was really lucky to have them all featured on my corporation for public radio radio show called thepromisedland.org.
now they &apos;re all very practical visionaries .
they take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money &apos;s flowing to meet those demands .
and when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with unemployed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
in fact , they make up some of what i call the most expensive citizens , and they include generationally impoverished , traumatized vets returning from the middle east , people coming out of jail .
and for the veterans in particular , the v.a. said there &apos;s a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003 .
i think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
and there are plenty of other examples like that .
one problem : waste handling and unemployment .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities , diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
and where is this waste handled ? usually in poor communities .
and we know that eco-industrial business , these kinds of business models -- there &apos;s a model in europe called the eco-industrial park , where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another , or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and in my hometown , we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx , but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail .
they &apos;ve since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
another problem : unhealthy food systems and unemployment .
working-class and poor urban americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system .
it relies too much on transportation , chemical fertilization , big use of water and also refrigeration .
mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land , and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity .
and so we know &quot; urban ag &quot; is a big buzz topic this time of the year , but it &apos;s mostly gardening , which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it &apos;s not in terms of creating jobs or for food production .
the numbers just aren &apos;t there .
part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city , that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities , owned and operated by small growers , where now there are only consumers .
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can &apos;t meet the year-round demand for produce .
it &apos;s not a competition with rural farm ; it &apos;s actually reinforcements .
it allies in a really positive and economically viable food system .
the goal is to meet the cities &apos; institutional demands for hospitals , senior centers , schools , daycare centers , and produce a network of regional jobs , as well .
this is smart infrastructure .
and how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day .
smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs .
and we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
so i &apos;m hoping you can see a little theme here .
these examples indicate a trend .
i haven &apos;t created it , and it &apos;s not happening by accident .
i &apos;m noticing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
and we all need to be invested in it .
it is an essential pillar to this country &apos;s recovery .
and i call it &quot; hometown security . &quot;
the recession has us reeling and fearful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very empowering .
it &apos;s a realization that we are the key to our own recovery .
now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local .
and when we do that , our neighbors -- be they next-door , or in the next state , or in the next country -- the sum of the local is the global .
hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses , putting people to work , restoring our natural systems .
hometown security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destroying it overseas .
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across america .
the challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more .
now , hometown security is about taking care of your own , but it &apos;s not like the old saying , &quot; charity begins at home . &quot;
i recently read a book called &quot; love leadership &quot; by john hope bryant .
and it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
see , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
he grew up in the segregated south , escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
and his was gambling , compulsively .
to him that phrase , &quot; charity begins at home , &quot; meant that my payday -- or someone else &apos;s -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day .
so you need to help him out .
and sometimes i would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs , and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a racetrack in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
he made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that i grew up in .
so i &apos;m not that unhappy about that .
but listen , i did feel obligated to him , and i grew up -- then i grew up .
and i &apos;m a grown woman now , and i have learned a few things along the way .
to me , charity often is just about giving , because you &apos;re supposed to , or because it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always done , or it &apos;s about giving until it hurts .
i &apos;m about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- i &apos;m not trying to feed the habit .
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
and over the past 20 years , we &apos;ve spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems , yet educational outcomes , malnutrition , incarceration , obesity , diabetes , income disparity , they &apos;ve all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular , infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it &apos;s a great world that we &apos;re bringing them into as well .
and i know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , i spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex , and i &apos;m a recovering executive director , two years clean .
but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
the greater our success , the less money came in from foundations .
and i tell you , being on the ted stage and winning a macarthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that i had arrived .
and by the time i &apos;d moved on , i was actually covering a third of my agency &apos;s budget deficit with speaking fees .
but since then , the park that was just a dump and was featured at a ted2006 talk became this little thing .
but i did in fact get married in it .
over here .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .
the south bronx greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006 .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here .
and we love this , because i love construction now , because we &apos;re watching these things actually happen .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
hometown security is next on my to-do list .
what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
we need to work together to embrace and repair our land , repair our power systems and repair ourselves .
it &apos;s time to stop building the shopping malls , the prisons , the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures .
it is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility .
thank you very much .
majora carter : 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship
the future of green is local -- and entrepreneurial . in her talk , majora carter brings us the stories of three people who are saving their own communities while saving the planet . call it &quot; hometown security . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
&quot; even in purely non-religious terms , homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty .
it is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality -- a pitiable flight from life .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness . &quot;
that &apos;s from time magazine in 1966 , when i was three years old .
and last year , the president of the united states came out in favor of gay marriage .
how did an illness become an identity ?
when i was perhaps six years old , i went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother .
and at the end of buying our shoes , the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home .
my brother wanted a red balloon , and i wanted a pink balloon .
my mother said that she thought i &apos;d really rather have a blue balloon .
but i said that i definitely wanted the pink one .
and she reminded me that my favorite color was blue .
the fact that my favorite color now is blue , but i &apos;m still gay -- -- is evidence of both my mother &apos;s influence and its limits .
when i was little , my mother used to say , &quot; the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
and when i was little , i took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me .
and when i was an adolescent , i thought that i &apos;m gay , and so i probably can &apos;t have a family .
and when she said it , it made me anxious .
and after i came out of the closet , when she continued to say it , it made me furious .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m gay . that &apos;s not the direction that i &apos;m headed in .
and i want you to stop saying that . &quot;
about 20 years ago , i was asked by my editors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about deaf culture .
and i was rather taken aback .
i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness .
those poor people , they couldn &apos;t hear .
they lacked hearing , and what could we do for them ?
and then i went out into the deaf world .
i saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry .
i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville , tennessee where people complained about that slurry southern signing .
and as i plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world , i become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said , &quot; we don &apos;t lack hearing , we have membership in a culture , &quot; were saying something that was viable .
it wasn &apos;t my culture , and i didn &apos;t particularly want to rush off and join it , but i appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it , it felt as valuable as latino culture or gay culture or jewish culture .
it felt as valid perhaps even as american culture .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me .
she was facing the question of what to do with this child .
should she say , &quot; you &apos;re just like everyone else but a little bit shorter ? &quot;
or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity , get involved in the little people of america , become aware of what was happening for dwarfs ?
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
most gay people are born to straight parents .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter .
and i thought , there it is again : a family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary .
and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
there are vertical identities , which are passed down generationally from parent to child .
those are things like ethnicity , frequently nationality , language , often religion .
those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children .
and while some of them can be difficult , there &apos;s no attempt to cure them .
you can argue that it &apos;s harder in the united states -- our current presidency notwithstanding -- to be a person of color .
there are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group .
and i call them horizontal identities , because the peer group is the horizontal experience .
these are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers .
and those identities , those horizontal identities , people have almost always tried to cure .
and i wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them .
and it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place .
there &apos;s self-acceptance , there &apos;s family acceptance , and there &apos;s social acceptance .
and they don &apos;t always coincide .
and a lot of the time , people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don &apos;t love them , when what actually has happened is that their parents don &apos;t accept them .
love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child .
but acceptance is something that takes time .
it always takes time .
one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown .
when he was born , he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism , a very disabling condition , and his parents were told that he would never walk , he would never talk , he would have no intellectual capacity , and he would probably not even recognize them .
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
and his mother said she wasn &apos;t going to do it .
and she took her son home .
and even though she didn &apos;t have a lot of educational or financial advantages , she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism , and she got clinton enrolled with him .
and in the course of his childhood , he had 30 major surgical procedures .
and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures , as a result of which he now can walk .
and while he was there , they sent tutors around to help him with his school work .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
he was the first one in his family , in fact , to go to college , where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car that accommodated his unusual body .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college nearby -- and she said , &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
&quot; and i thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet tall , he &apos;s three feet tall .
two beers for them is four beers for him . &quot;
she said , &quot; i knew i couldn &apos;t go in there and interrupt him , but i went home , and i left him eight messages on his cell phone . &quot;
she said , &quot; and then i thought , if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he &apos;d go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- &quot; and i said to her , &quot; what do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming , accomplished , wonderful person ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; what did i do ? i loved him , that &apos;s all .
clinton just always had that light in him .
and his father and i were lucky enough to be the first to see it there . &quot;
i &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 60s .
this one is from 1968 -- the atlantic monthly , voice of liberal america -- written by an important bioethicist .
he said , &quot; there is no reason to feel guilty about putting a down syndrome child away , whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible , lethal sense .
it is sad , yes -- dreadful . but it carries no guilt .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
the fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day .
but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences , how we used to see people who were disabled , how inhuman we held people to be .
and the change that &apos;s been accomplished there , which is almost equally radical , is one that we pay not very much attention to .
one of the families i interviewed , tom and karen robards , were taken aback when , as young and successful new yorkers , their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome .
they thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be , and so they decided they would build a little center -- two classrooms that they started with a few other parents -- to educate kids with d.s.
and over the years , that center grew into something called the cooke center , where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught .
in the time since that atlantic monthly story ran , the life expectancy for people with down syndrome has tripled .
the robards had a lot to do with that .
and i said , &quot; do you regret it ?
do you wish your child didn &apos;t have down syndrome ?
do you wish you &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;
and interestingly his father said , &quot; well , for david , our son , i regret it , because for david , it &apos;s a difficult way to be in the world , and i &apos;d like to give david an easier life .
but i think if we lost everyone with down syndrome , it would be a catastrophic loss . &quot;
and karen robards said to me , &quot; i &apos;m with tom .
for david , i would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life .
but speaking for myself -- well , i would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point -- speaking for myself , it &apos;s made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life , that speaking for myself , i wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything in the world . &quot;
we live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up .
and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before .
most deaf infants born in the united states now will receive cochlear implants , which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver , and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech .
a compound that has been tested in mice , bmn-111 , is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene .
achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism , and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene , grow to full size .
testing in humans is around the corner .
there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies , or to terminate them .
and so we have both social progress and medical progress .
and i believe in both of them .
i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful , and i think the same thing about the medical progress .
but i think it &apos;s a tragedy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
and when i see the way they &apos;re intersecting in conditions like the three i &apos;ve just described , i sometimes think it &apos;s like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan .
we have to think about how we feel about cures altogether .
jim sinclair , a prominent autism activist , said , &quot; when parents say &apos; i wish my child did not have autism , &apos; what they &apos;re really saying is &apos; i wish the child i have did not exist and i had a different , non-autistic child instead . &apos; read that again . this is what we hear when you mourn over our existence .
this is what we hear when you pray for a cure -- that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
it &apos;s a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don &apos;t want to be cured or changed or eliminated .
they want to be whoever it is that they &apos;ve come to be .
one of the families i interviewed for this project was the family of dylan klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the columbine massacre .
it took a long time to persuade them to talk to me , and once they agreed , they were so full of their story that they couldn &apos;t stop telling it .
and the first weekend i spent with them -- the first of many -- i recorded more than 20 hours of conversation .
and on sunday night , we were all exhausted .
we were sitting in the kitchen . sue klebold was fixing dinner .
and i said , &quot; if dylan were here now , do you have a sense of what you &apos;d want to ask him ? &quot;
and his father said , &quot; i sure do .
i &apos;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing . &quot;
and sue looked at the floor , and she thought for a minute .
and then she looked back up and said , &quot; i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
when i had dinner with her a couple of years later -- one of many dinners that we had together -- she said , &quot; you know , when it first happened , i used to wish that i had never married , that i had never had children .
if i hadn &apos;t gone to ohio state and crossed paths with tom , this child wouldn &apos;t have existed and this terrible thing wouldn &apos;t have happened .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; she said .
&quot; so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born , i &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems , problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid , and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting .
and then i thought , all of us who have children love the children we have , with their flaws .
if some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children i have and give me other , better children -- more polite , funnier , nicer , smarter -- i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle .
it turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed -- there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia , there are only so many families of children who are transgender , there are only so many families of prodigies -- who also face similar challenges in many ways -- there are only so many families in each of those categories -- but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing , then you discover that it &apos;s a nearly universal phenomenon .
ironically , it turns out , that it &apos;s our differences , and our negotiation of difference , that unite us .
i decided to have children while i was working on this project .
and many people were astonished and said , &quot; but how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m not studying everything that can go wrong .
what i &apos;m studying is how much love there can be , even when everything appears to be going wrong . &quot;
i thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child i had seen , a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect .
and when his ashes were interred , his mother said , &quot; i pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed , once of the child i wanted and once of the son i loved . &quot;
and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
so my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in minneapolis .
i had a close friend from college who &apos;d gone through a divorce and wanted to have children .
and so she and i have a daughter , and mother and daughter live in texas .
and my husband and i have a son who lives with us all the time of whom i am the biological father , and our surrogate for the pregnancy was laura , the lesbian mother of oliver and lucy in minneapolis .
so the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
and i don &apos;t accept subtractive models of love , only additive ones .
and i believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on , so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness .
the day after our son was born , the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
he wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
in so far as he was extending them , he was doing so asymmetrically , which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action .
and as she told me all of these things , i felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor .
and i thought , here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled , and i didn &apos;t want to join their number .
because what i was encountering was an idea of illness .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , i wanted to protect my child from illness .
and i wanted also to protect myself from illness .
and yet , i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for , that those would ultimately be his identity , and if they were his identity they would become my identity , that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded .
we took him to the mri machine , we took him to the cat scanner , we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw .
we felt helpless .
and at the end of five hours , they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly .
and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on , she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp .
but i thought how my mother was right .
i thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
i think children had ensnared me the moment i connected fatherhood with loss .
but i &apos;m not sure i would have noticed that if i hadn &apos;t been so in the thick of this research project of mine .
i &apos;d encountered so much strange love , and i fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns .
and i saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities .
during these 10 years , i had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility , and i had come to see how it conquers everything else .
and while i had sometimes thought the parents i was interviewing were fools , enslaving themselves to a lifetime &apos;s journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery , i realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that i was ready to join them on their ship .
thank you .
andrew solomon : love , no matter what
what is it like to raise a child who &apos;s different from you in some fundamental way ? in this quietly moving talk , writer andrew solomon shares what he learned from talking to dozens of parents -- asking them : what &apos;s the line between unconditional love and unconditional acceptance ?
most people don &apos;t know that when i went to high school in this country -- i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculptor .
my family was wealthy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted .
and i announced i wanted to be a sculptor in paris .
and he was a clever man . he sort of said , &quot; well , that &apos;s ok , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math sats . &quot;
in fact , i &apos;d got an 800 . and he thought i did very well -- and i did , too -- in the arts : this was my passion .
and he said &quot; if you go to mit , &quot; to which i had been given early admission , &quot; i will pay for every year you &apos;re at mit , in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris . &quot;
and i thought that was the best deal in town , so i accepted it immediately .
and i decided that if i was good in art , and i was good in mathematics , i &apos;d study architecture , which was the blending of the two .
i went and told my headmaster that , at prep school .
and i said to him what i was doing , that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together .
he said to me something that just went completely over my head .
he said , &quot; you know , i like grey suits , and i like pin-striped suits , but i don &apos;t like grey pin-striped suits . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; what a turkey this guy is , &quot; and i went off to mit .
i studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t architecture .
that really , the mixing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjoyed a career doing that .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim citrin &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab passing the baton on , i thought , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project .
something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had . &quot;
and in the case of the media lab , knowing a lot of people , knowing people who were either executives or wealthy , and also not having , in my own case , a career to worry about anymore .
my career , i mean , i &apos;d done my career .
didn &apos;t have to worry about earning money .
didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
and i said , &quot; boy , let &apos;s really do something that takes advantage of all these features , &quot; and thought that if we could address education , by leveraging the children , and bringing to the world the access of the computers , that that was really the thing we should do .
it &apos;s taken at three o &apos;clock in the morning , without the permission of the company .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re stacked up .
those are conveyor belts that go around .
this is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by , but then you &apos;ll see the ones up above .
what happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
but you &apos;ve got to have the thing moving on the assembly line , because it &apos;s constant .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
this picture was taken in 1982 , just before the ibm pc was even announced .
seymour papert and i were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself .
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .
and when people tell me , &quot; who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
i say to myself , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room -- i don &apos;t care how techie you are -- there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . ok ?
we all need help , even those of us who are very seasoned .
this picture of seymour -- 25 years ago . seymour made a very simple observation in 1968 , and then basically presented it in 1970 -- april 11 to be precise -- called &quot; teaching children thinking . &quot;
what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they debug the programs , they come the closest to learning about learning .
that was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that .
kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything i hope this brings back , it &apos;s programming to kids .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
this is being launched with three languages in it : squeak , logo , and a third , that i &apos;ve never even seen before .
this photograph is very important because it &apos;s much later .
this is in the early 2000s . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what spirited this , plus the influence of joe and others . we started one laptop per child .
this is the same village in cambodia , just a couple of months ago .
these kids are real pros . there were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids . being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental .
everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit , but they were all wrong .
and the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold .
there are many reasons , but the two that merit the little bit of time is : one , the clarity of purpose is there . the moral purpose is clear .
i can see any head of state , any executive i want , at any time , because i &apos;m not selling laptops . ok ? i have no shareholders .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference whatsoever .
the clarity of purpose is absolutely critical . and the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world .
if you look at our professional services , including search firms , including communications , including legal services , including banking , they &apos;re all pro bono . and it &apos;s not to save money .
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
we couldn &apos;t afford to hire a cfo . we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary , and we had a queue of people .
it allows you to team up with people . the u.n. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos;re profit making . so announcing this with kofi annan was very important , and the u.n. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . and this was the machine we were showing before i met yves behar .
and while this machine in some sense is silly , in retrospect , it actually served a very important purpose .
that pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody .
everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank . it &apos;s different .
it was getting its power in a different way . it &apos;s kind of childlike .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
in spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
i didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better off-board .
and then , i could tell you lots about the laptop , but i decided on just four things .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
that computer is unlike anything you &apos;ve had , and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don &apos;t come close to . and it &apos;s very important to be low power , and i hope that &apos;s picked up more by the industry .
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
dual-mode display -- that sunlight display &apos;s fantastic .
we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight , and the more sunlight the better .
and that was really critical . the mesh network , it &apos;ll become commonplace .
and of course , &quot; rugged &quot; goes without saying .
and the reason i think design matters isn &apos;t because i wanted to go to art school .
and by the way , when i graduated from mit , i thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to paris for six years .
so , i didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product .
most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
and , in english , the word &quot; cheap &quot; has a double meaning , which is really appropriate , because it &apos;s cheap , in the pejorative sense , as well as inexpensive .
but if you take a different approach , and you think of very large-scale integration , very advanced materials , very advanced manufacturing -- so you &apos;re pouring chemicals in one end , ipods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design , that &apos;s what we wanted to do .
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn &apos;t compare notes .
these are his slides , and so i don &apos;t have to talk about them .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
yves showed one of the power-generating devices .
the mesh network , the reason i -- and i won &apos;t go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world , they &apos;re connected . there &apos;s not just laptops .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
if you &apos;re in the jungle , it &apos;s about 500 meters . so if a kid bicycles home , or walks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the grid , so to speak .
they &apos;re not going to be near another laptop , so you have to nail these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
you don &apos;t call verizon or sprint . you build your own network .
and that &apos;s very important , the user interface .
we are launching with 18 keyboards . english is by far the minority .
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
i &apos;m willing to suspect some of you hadn &apos;t even heard of them before .
is there anybody in the room , one person , unless you work with olpc , is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that &apos;s on the screen ? there &apos;s only one hand -- so you get it .
yes , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s right . it &apos;s amharic , it &apos;s ethiopian . in ethiopia , there &apos;s never been a keyboard .
there is no keyboard standard because there &apos;s no market .
and this is the big difference .
again , when you &apos;re a nonprofit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
so we went to ethiopia , and we helped them make a keyboard .
and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard .
so what i want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . i decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now -- is to go to six countries .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it &apos;s rich .
here &apos;s the six . we went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million .
we thought , this is exactly the right strategy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries .
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
in each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
this was a period in my life where i was traveling 330 days per year .
in the case of libya , it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent .
the camel smells were unbelievable .
and it was 45 degrees c. i mean , this was not what you &apos;d call a cool experience . and former countries -- i say former , because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press release .
so we went to smaller ones . uruguay , bless their hearts .
small country , not so rich . president said he &apos;d do it , and guess what ?
he did do it . the tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sunlight-readable , mesh-network , low-power , but just a vanilla laptop proposal .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay , the first 100,000 , boom , went to olpc .
the next day -- the next day , not even 24 hours had passed -- in peru , the president of peru said , &quot; we &apos;ll do 250 . &quot; and boom , a little domino effect .
the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it .
